It just goes to show that you haven't bothered to get any<br />&gt; feedback on this patch which is significantly invasive before merging it.<br />&gt; This is completely unreasonable behaviour for a kernel series which is<br />&gt; supposed to be stable.<br /><br />No, it goes to show that I didn't actually apply all of Andrea's patches.<br />I left out a number of patches that I didn't see the point to, or that I<br />just plain disagreed with.<br /><br />And some of the patches had some non-obvious dependencies, especially as I<br />have a reasonably recent compiler..<br /><br />&gt; The code in question does not attempt to explain itself at all.  Your release<br />&gt; notes did not explain what changes you did at all.  Nor are your patches<br />&gt; split up into reasonable chunks of functionality that can be evaluated based<br />&gt; on their individual merit.  All or nothing is *not* the approach that should<br />&gt; be taken at present.  (Hint, stability is acheived gradually.)<br /><br />Actually, many of them _are_ split up, much more so than Alan's public<br />patches are (now, Alan in private splits up the patches really well, so<br />for me it tends to be even easier to apply Alans patches than Andreas, but<br />as with Alan, my one-liner "merged with xxxx" doesn't go into the detail<br />that Andrea and others actually do have).<br /><br />Now, the VM part of the patch was certainly fairly big. I doubt much of it<br />could have been reasonably split up, though.<br /><br />&gt; No, what I'm deeply concerned with is the nature of patch merging.  There was<br />&gt; no obvious public testing of the changes before merging, no warning of it, the<br />&gt; patch contained obvious bogus chunks and many unrelated changes.  I've never<br />&gt; seen as invasive a patch merged that ran the risk of completely torpedoing<br />&gt; stability merged into a STABLE KERNEL SERIES, nor would I ever consider<br />&gt; submitting such a patch.  There are bug fixes that are outstanding in -ac<br />&gt; that aren't being merged to -linus, yet this completely untested pile of messy<br />&gt; code is merged without hesitation?<br /><br />Without hesitation? Hardly.<br /><br />The bug fixes in -ac that aren't merged into -linus are that way BECAUSE<br />NOBODY HAS SENT ME MERGES.<br /><br />Alan works on it quite intensively, but the fact is, that for the -ac<br />merge, Alan seems to be able to merge it slower than -ac grows. Which is<br />why I actually started asking people to merge their parts from -ac into<br />-linus to help Alan. That's how the other merge in -pre11 happened.<br /><br />The aa tree has existed for a long time, and is actually mainted in better<br />chunks than the -ac tree, which makes it easier to merge. Admittedly my<br />and Alans tastes are often closer than mine and Andreas, which means that<br />the -aa tree merges are more painful for _me_ ;)<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
