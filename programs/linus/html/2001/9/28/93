I imagine that the internal clocks are driven by PLLs,<br />&gt; DLLs or something similar.  Unless multiple oscillators are used, this<br />&gt; means that speed switching is gradual, over several hundred or many more<br />&gt; clock cycles.<br /><br />Basically, there's the "slow" timer, and the fast one. The slow one always<br />runs, and fast one gives the precision but runs at CPU speed.<br /><br />So yes, there are multiple oscillators, and no, they should not drift on<br />frequency shifting, because the slow and constant one is used to scale the<br />fast one. So no cumulative errors.<br /><br />HOWEVER, anybody who believes that TSC is a "truly accurate clock" will be<br />sadly mistaken on any machine. Even PLL's drift over time, and as<br />mentioned, Intel already broke the "you can use TSC as wall time" in their<br />SpeedStep implementation. Who knows what their future CPU's will do..<br /><br />&gt; I can now use `rdtsc' to measure time in userspace, rather more<br />&gt; accurately than gettimeofday(). (In fact I have worked with programs<br />&gt; that do this, for network traffic injection.).  I can do this over a<br />&gt; period of minutes, expecting the clock to match "wall clock" time<br />&gt; reasonably accurately.<br /><br />It will work on Crusoe.<br /><br />&gt; (One hardware implementation that doesn't have this problem is to run a<br />&gt; small counter, say 3 or 4 bits, at the nominal clock speed all the time,<br />&gt; and have the slower core sample that.  But it may use a little more<br />&gt; power, and your note about FP scaling tells me you don't do that).<br /><br />We do that, but the other way around. The thing is, the "nominal clock<br />speed" doesn't even _exist_ when running normally.<br /><br />What does exist is the bus clock (well, a multiple of it, but you get the<br />idea), and that one is stable. I bet PCI devices don't like to be randomly<br />driven at frequencies "somewhere between 12 and 33MHz" depending on load ;)<br /><br />But because the stable frequency is the _slow_ one, you can't just scale<br />that up (well, you could - you could just run your cycle counter at 66MHz<br />all the time, and you couldn't measure smaller intervals, and people would<br />be really disappointed). So you need the scaling of the fast one..<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
