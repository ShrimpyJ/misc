It was when the<br />&gt; Internet hype was going full force, and nobody (including myself) could be<br />&gt; faulted for getting swept up in the wave that it was.<br /><br />That's not the problem, I think.<br /><br />2.4.0 was appropriate for the time. The problem with _any_ big release is<br />that the people you _really_ want to test it won't test it until it is<br />stable, and you cannot make it stable before you have lots of testers. A<br />basic chicken-and-egg problem, in short.<br /><br />You find the same thing (to a smaller degree) with the pre-patches, where<br />a lot more people end up testing the non-pre-patches, and inevitably there<br />are more percieved problems with the "real" version than with the<br />pre-patch. Just statistically you should realize that that is not actually<br />true ;)<br /><br />&gt; 1) Develop 2.5 until it is ready to be 2.6 and immediately give it over to<br />&gt; a maintainer, and start 2.7.<br /><br />I'd love to do that, but it doesn't really work very well. Simply because<br />whenever the "stable" fork happens, there are going to be issues that the<br />bleeding-edge guard didn't notice, or didn't realize how they bite people<br />in the real world.<br /><br />So I could throw a 2.6 directly over the fence, and start a 2.7 series,<br />but that would have two really killer problems<br /><br /> (a) I really don't like giving something bad to whoever gets to be<br />     maintainer of the stable kernel. It just doesn't work that way:<br />     whoever would be willing to maintain such a stable kernel would be a<br />     real sucker and a glutton for punishment.<br /><br /> (b) Even if I found a glutton for punishment that was intelligent enough<br />     in other ways to be a good maintainer, the _development_ tree too<br />     needs to start off from a "known reasonably good" point. It doesn't<br />     have to be perfect, but it needs to be _known_.<br /><br />For good of for bad, we actually have that now with 2.4.x - the system<br />does look fairly stable, with just some silly problems that have known<br />solutions and aren't a major pain to handle. So the 2.5.x release is off<br />to a good start, which it simply wouldn't have had if I had just cut over<br />from 2.4.0.<br /><br />The _real_ solution is to make fewer fundamental changes between stable<br />kernels, and that's a real solution that I expect to become more and more<br />realistic as the kernel stabilizes. I already expect 2.5 to have a _lot_<br />less fundamental changes than the 2.3.x tree ever had - the SMP<br />scaliability efforts and page-cachification between 2.2.x and 2.4.x is<br />really quite a big change.<br /><br />But you also have to realize that "fewer fundamental changes" is a mark of<br />a system that isn't evolving as quickly, and that is reaching middle age.<br />We are probably not quite there yet ;)<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
