We have to use intellect<br />&gt; to root out the obviously bad ideas, and even more importantly the<br />&gt; bad-but-not-obviously-bad ideas.<br /><br />Directed evolution - ie evolution that has more specific goals, and faster<br />penalties for perceived failure, works on the scale of tens or hundreds of<br />years, not tens of thousands. Look at dog breeding, but look even more at<br />livestock breeding, where just a few decades have made a big difference.<br /><br />The belief that evolution is necessarily slow is totally unfounded.<br /><br />HOWEVER, the belief that _too_ much direction is bad is certainly not<br />unfounded: it tends to show up major design problems that do not show up<br />with less control. Again, see overly aggressive breeding of some dogs<br />causing bad characteristics, and especially the poultry industry.<br /><br />And you have to realize that the above is with entities that are much more<br />complex than your random software project, and where historically you have<br />not been able to actually influence anything but selection itself.<br /><br />Being able to influence not just selection, but actually influencing the<br />_mutations_ that happen directly obviously cuts down the time by another<br />large piece.<br /><br />In short, your comment about "not pertinent" only shows that you are<br />either not very well informed about biological changes, or, more likely,<br />it's just a gut reaction without actually _thinking_ about it.<br /><br />Biological evolution is alive and well, and does not take millions of<br />years to make changes. In fact, most paleolontologists consider some of<br />the changes due to natural disasters to have happened susprisingly fast,<br />even in the _absense_ of "intelligent direction".<br /><br />Of course, at the same time evolution _does_ heavily tend to favour<br />"stable" life-forms (sharks and many amphibians have been around for<br />millions of years). That's not because evolution is slow, but simply<br />because good lifeforms work well in their environments, and if the<br />environment doesn't change radically they have very few pressures to<br />change.<br /><br />There is no inherent "goodness" in change. In fact, there are a lot of<br />reasons _against_ change, something we often forget in technology. The<br />fact that evolution is slow when there is no big reason to evolve is a<br />_goodness_, not a strike against it.<br /><br />&gt; &gt; Quite frankly, Sun is doomed. And it has nothing to do with their<br />&gt; &gt; engineering practices or their coding style.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; I'd love to hear your thoughts on why.<br /><br />You heard them above. Sun is basically inbreeding. That tends to be good<br />to bring out specific characteristics of a breed, and tends to be good for<br />_specialization_. But it's horrible for actual survival, and generates a<br />very one-sided system that does not adapt well to change.<br /><br />Microsoft, for all the arguments against them, is better off simply<br />because of the size of its population - they have a much wider consumer<br />base, which in turn has caused them largely to avoid specialization. As a<br />result, Microsoft has a much wider appeal - and suddenly most of the<br />niches that Sun used to have are all gone, and its fighting for its life<br />in many of its remaining ones.<br /><br />Why do you think Linux ends up being the most widely deployed Unix? It's<br />avoided niches, it's avoided inbreeding, and not being too directed means<br />that it doesn't get the problems you see with unbalanced systems.<br /><br />Face it, being one-sided is a BAD THING. Unix was dying because it was<br />becoming much too one-sided.<br /><br />Try to prove me wrong.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
