All of my systems have total swap<br />&gt; space less than their physical memory size and are running 2.4.13 kernels.<br /><br />No. With the two-liner patch on linux-kernel, your old setup should work<br />as-is.<br /><br />And performance will be fine, _except_ if you regularly actually have your<br />swap usage up in the 75%+ range. But if you do work that typically puts a<br />lot of pressure on swap, and you find that you almost always end up using<br />clearly more than half your swapspace, that implies that you should<br />consider perhaps reconfiguring so that you have a bigger swap partition.<br /><br />When I pointed out the performance problems to Lorenzo, I specifically<br />meant only that one load that he is testing - the fact that the load fills<br />up the swap device implies that for _that_ load, performance could be<br />improved by making sure he has enough swap to cover it.<br /><br />I bet Lorenzo doesn't even come _close_ to 80% full swap under normal<br />usage, so he probably wouldn't see any performance impact normally. It's<br />just that when you report VM benchmarks, maybe you want to try to improve<br />the numbers..<br /><br />[ It's equally valid to say that Lorenzo's numbers are _especially_<br />  interesting exactly because they also test the behaviour when we need to<br />  start pruning the swap cache, though. So I'm in no way trying to<br />  criticise his benchmark - I think the qsort benchmark is actually one of<br />  the more valid VM patterns we have ever had as a benchmark, and I<br />  really like how it mixes random accesses with non-random ones ]<br /><br />So don't worry.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
