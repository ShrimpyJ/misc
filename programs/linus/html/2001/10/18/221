Surely there should be some<br />&gt; readahead happening.<br /><br />Well, we _could_ do read-ahead even for the read-modify-write, but the<br />fact is that it doesn't tend to be worth it for real-life loads.<br /><br />That's because read-modify-write is _usually_ of the type where you lseek,<br />and modify a smallish thing in-place: anybody who cares about performance<br />and does consecutive modifications should have coalesced them anyway, so<br />only made-up benchmarks actually show the problem.<br /><br />&gt; I tested the same program under Solaris and I get about a factor of 2<br />&gt; difference regardless whether its one copy or 5 copies.<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if Solaris just always reads ahead. Most "big<br />iron" unixes try very very hard to make all IO in big chunks, whether it<br />is necessary or not.<br /><br />&gt; I believe that this is an odd situation and sure it only happens for<br />&gt; badly written program. I can see that it would be stupid to optimise for<br />&gt; this situation.<br />&gt; But do we really need to do this badly for this case?<br /><br />Well, if you find a real application that cares, I might change my mind,<br />but right now read-ahead looks like a waste of time to me.. Does anybody<br />really do re-write in practice?<br /><br />(Yes, I know about databases, but they tend to want to be cached anyway,<br />and tend to do direct block IO, not sub-block read-modify-write).<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
