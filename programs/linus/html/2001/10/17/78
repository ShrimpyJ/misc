Does this<br />behaviour show up on 2.4.x too? It sounds like a performance buglet in the<br />kernel or some infrastructure, really.<br /><br />The one problem with pre-reading is that it will now artificially touch<br />the data twice, and when running on 2.4.x it will activate the pages.<br />That's going to be exactly what _I_ want it to do on my machine, but<br />others are likely to be less happy about it.<br /><br />Btw, why use "slurp()" and actually doing the memory allocations etc, only<br />to throw it away again? It would be better to either really keep the<br />allocation around (which would also fix the touch-twice issue but would<br />cause much more changes to 'diff'), or to just read into the same buffer<br />over and over again..<br /><br />And I've for a long time thought about adding a "readahead()" system call.<br />There are just too many uses for it, it has come up in many different<br />areas..<br /><br />&gt; This was all running under a 2.2.x kernel btw; might have time to<br />&gt; test on a 2.4.x one later.  Either way, it kind of makes you wonder<br />&gt; why nobody had done this earlier (not to mention feeding the source<br />&gt; to indent -kr -i8...)<br /><br />Who's the maintainer for "diff" these days? This change seems small and<br />simple enough that they might accept it, and I'd love to see it. I'll<br />probably do this in my copy anyway, but it would be nicer to not have to<br />patch it specially..<br /><br />As to using sane indentation - you're talking about a FSF-maintained<br />thing. Which means that they'll almost certainly not fix their horrible<br />problems with indentation ;(<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
