The scheduler is about 100 lines<br />out of however-many-million (3.8 at least count), and doesn't even impact<br />most normal performace very much.<br /><br />We'll clearly do per-CPU runqueues or something some day. And that worries<br />me not one whit, compared to thigns like VM and block device layer ;)<br /><br />I know a lot of people think schedulers are important, and the operating<br />system theory about them is overflowing - it's one of those things that<br />people can argue about forever, yet is conceptually simple enough that<br />people aren't afraid of it. I just personally never found it to be a major<br />issue.<br /><br />Let's face it - the current scheduler has the same old basic structure<br />that it did almost 10 years ago, and yes, it's not optimal, but there<br />really aren't that many real-world loads where people really care. I'm<br />sorry, but it's true.<br /><br />And you have to realize that there are not very many things that have<br />aged as well as the scheduler. Which is just another proof that scheduling<br />is easy.<br /><br />We've rewritten the VM several times in the last ten years, and I expect<br />it will be changed several more times in the next few years. Withing five<br />years we'll almost certainly have to make the current three-level page<br />tables be four levels etc.<br /><br />In comparison to those kinds of issues, I suspect that making the<br />scheduler use per-CPU queues together with some inter-CPU load balancing<br />logic is probably _trivial_. Patches already exist, and I don't feel that<br />people can screw up the few hundred lines too badly.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
