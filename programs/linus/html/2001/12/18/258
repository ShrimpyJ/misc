I can't make them<br />&gt; comment.<br /><br />Well, if people aren't interested, then it doesn't _ever_ go in.<br /><br />Remember: we do not add features just because we can.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I don't think you've told that many people. I haven't seen<br />any discussion about the aio stuff on linux-kernel, which may be because<br />you posted several announcements and nobody cared, or it may be that<br />you've only mentioned it fleetingly and people didn't notice.<br /><br />Take a look at how long it took for ext3 to be "standard" - I put them in<br />my tree when I started getting real feedback that it was used and people<br />liked using it. I simply do not like applying patches "just to get users".<br />Not even reservations - because I reserve the right to _never_ apply<br />something if critical review ends up saying that "that doesn't make<br />sense".<br /><br />Quite frankly, the fact that it is being tested out at places like Oracle<br />etc is secondary - those people will use anything. That's proven by<br />history. That doesn't mean that _I_ accept anything.<br /><br />Now, the fact that I like the interfaces is actually secondary - it does<br />make me much more likely to include it even in a half-baked thing, but it<br />does NOT mean that I trust my own taste so much that I'd do it "under the<br />covers" with little open discussion, use and modification.<br /><br />Where _is_ the discussion on linux-kernel?<br /><br />Where are the negative comments from Al? (Al _always_ has negative<br />comments and suggestions for improvements, don't try to say that he also<br />liked it unconditionally ;)<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
