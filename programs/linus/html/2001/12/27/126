Old patches<br />&gt; &gt; simply grow stale: keeping track of them is not necessarily at all<br />&gt; &gt; useful, and can add more work than anything else.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; *nod*, until they get scooped up into another tree -ac, -dj, -whatever<br />&gt; and fed to you whenever you're in the mood for resyncing.<br /><br />But that's nothing more than "somebody else maintains them".<br /><br />I realize that quite often the author of the patch is not going to be its<br />maintainer, which is exactly why all the other trees are so useful.<br /><br />Everybody should realize that "outside trees" are not a rogue thing. They<br />are _very_ important, for several reasons:<br /><br /> - competition keeps people honest. If I was the only holder of the keys,<br />   nobody would even _know_ if I was corrupt. And nobody could choose with<br />   his feet.<br /><br />   Look at politics: if you don't have choices, the one choice _will_ be<br />   corrupt even if it started out with all the best intentions. The old<br />   adage there is "Power corrupts. Absolute power corrupts absolutely".<br /><br /> - Different taste. Let's face it, a lot of programming is about having<br />   taste. Sometimes I don't like the way things are done, and people prove<br />   me wrong by other means. See the whole thing about the VM stuff with<br />   Andrea's patches - one of the reasons I hadn't applied the much earlier<br />   patches by Andrea was that I didn't like the zone-balancing approach.<br /><br />   Having external trees is _crucial_ for allowing different approaches to<br />   co-exist, in order to show their strengths and weaknesses. And I tend<br />   to be fairly open to admitting when I did something wrong, and somebody<br />   else had a better tree. At least I _try_.<br /><br /> - Different goals. Many of the commercial vendors have vendor needs, and<br />   they (correctly) think that those needs are the most important thing,<br />   while I don't care about vendors and thus have different priorities.<br /><br />   Again, multiple trees are absolutely required to make this work.<br /><br /> - And imperfect patch retention. There's no question that I drop patches,<br />   some bad, but many good. And that's going to be true of _anybody_ who<br />   maintains anything, except somebody who just accepts anything without<br />   question (eg CVS).<br /><br />I don't think I've ever spoken out against things like -ac, -dj and -aa: I<br />sometimes have to explain why I do not merge things whole-sale (which<br />would certainly be _technically_ the easiest solution much of the time),<br />and I often disagree with some part of the patch, but I'm actually<br />surprised how often I have to _defend_ having many trees.<br /><br />Just a historical note: one of the things I hated most about Minix was<br />that while Andrew Tanenbaum allowed external patches to the system, nobody<br />else could make a whole distribution. Which meant that while there existed<br />many trees and maintainers that were "better" (notably Bruce Evans, who<br />was considered to be a God of Minix), they were really painful to use, in<br />that you had to always do it from patches.<br /><br />I fully _expect_ that somebody better comes along. At some point, more<br />people will simply be using the -dj tree (or whatever), and that's fine.<br /><br />&gt; And when you're ready to resync what I've got so far (currently ~3mb),<br />&gt; it's going to be another full time job splitting it into bits to feed<br />&gt; you linus-bite-sized chunks. (ObSidenote: When this time comes btw,<br />&gt; if maintainers of relevant parts want to feed Linus their relevant<br />&gt; parts from my tree, that would be appreciated, and would keep _my_ load<br />&gt; down :-)<br /><br />This sounds absolutely wonderful..<br /><br />Note that you will notice that it's a _huge_ undertaking, and one of the<br />things that Alan complained about was how the fact that _I_ avoid scaling<br />meant that he had to scale more. I think it's a very valid complaint, and<br />it may make a whole lot more sense (if it is possible) to have different<br />people caring about different parts.<br /><br />Note that this may not be possible, due to lack of modularity. We've had<br />to actively change the tree layout of the kernel before just to make it<br />easier to maintain over several people. Which is painful, but not<br />certainly not impossible still..<br /><br />&gt; "Used to" ? cvs &#64; vger.samba.org was still being maintained before<br />&gt; I went on xmas vacation. Did I miss something ?<br /><br />Does he allow the wide and uncoordinated write access that he used to<br />allow? I thought he basically shut that down, and only allows a few people<br />now, exactly to avoid getting too horrible merge issues..<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
