The difference literally seems to be that in the old case it was<br />accidentally inlined.<br /><br />I say "accidentally", because "load_idt()" itself is explicitly<br />inlined, but the "set_idt()" in machine_kexec_32.c was not.<br /><br />But before that commit ("e802a51ede91 x86/idt: Consolidate IDT<br />invalidation") the compiler inlined it anyway because it was a small<br />static function.<br /><br />Afterwards, not so much (different C file), and then the stack tracing<br />code blew up because of the incomplete CPU state.<br /><br />&gt; This works.. I went back to the troublesome commit e802a51 and<br />&gt; modified it as follows:<br />&gt;<br />&gt; +/**<br />&gt; + * idt_invalidate - Invalidate interrupt descriptor table<br />&gt; + * &#64;addr:       The virtual address of the 'invalid' IDT<br />&gt; + */<br />&gt; +static inline void idt_invalidate(void *addr)<br />&gt; +{<br />&gt; +        struct desc_ptr idt = { .address = (unsigned long) addr, .size = 0 };<br />&gt; +<br />&gt; +        load_idt(&amp;idt);<br />&gt; +}<br /><br />Yes, I suspect that is the right thing to do. It's small enough that<br />inliningh it makes sense.<br /><br />HOWEVER. Would you mind testing a totally different fix instead?<br /><br />In particular, take the current top of tree (that doesn't work for<br />you), and try to just change the order of these two lines:<br /><br />        set_gdt(phys_to_virt(0), 0);<br />        idt_invalidate(phys_to_virt(0));<br /><br />in arch/x86/kernel/machine_kexec_32.c.<br /><br />I think it's a better idea to invalidate the IDT first, because that<br />is only used for exceptions. In contrast, invalidating the GDT will<br />obviously make any segment load do horrible things, _and_ any<br />exceptions would fail anyway (because exceptions need segments too).<br /><br />So in many ways, that "set_get()" that invalidates the GDT is the more<br />destructive thing, and should be done last.<br /><br />And if we do it last, maybe the whole "oops, we have tracing code<br />enabled" thing wouldn't have mattered.<br /><br />Does that trivial line switching make the old broken config work for you again?<br /><br />&gt; kexec now works as expected; tested repeatedly, both with direct<br />&gt; execution and crash triggering.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; I had to google 'inline function' :)).<br /><br />We'll make a kernel developer out of you yet. You've already found the<br />most important development tool (I kid, I kid. Google is useful, but<br />"willingness to try things out" is actually the #1 thing).<br /><br />Mind googling "linux kernel patch submission" and adding the required<br />sign-off, and I suspect the x86 people will happily take your patch?<br /><br />That said, I do wonder about a few things:<br /><br /> - the 'addr' argument is pointless, afaik. I *suspect* it used to be<br />0, and then some mindless editing just changed it to that<br />"phys_to_virt(0)".<br /><br />   With a zero length, it shouldn't matter what the actual IDT base<br />address actually is. Any access is going to trap regardless.<br /><br /> - some people were clearly aware of just how critical that whole<br />"load_idt()" sequence were, because things were marked "inline" and<br />"NOKPROBE_SYMBOL()" etc, but there was no comment in the code that<br />actually did this about how the machine state is total garbage after<br />the "set_gdt()" in machine_kexec().<br /><br /> - the above "I think we should invalidate GDT last" issue.<br /><br />Hmm?<br /><br />                  Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
