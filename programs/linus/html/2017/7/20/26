It might help keep<br />&gt; things more in order, but if there is a merge conflict caused by two<br />&gt; changes to adjacent entries causing patch "fuzz", splitting things<br />&gt; into 26 files A-Z isn't going to significantly decrease the odds of<br />&gt; this happening.<br /><br />So it would actually help me a lot with conflicts - not because they'd<br />happen less, but because *when* they happen, the end result is much<br />easier to look at.<br /><br />When I resolve a conflict, I always want to look at the commits that<br />cause the conflict. So what do I do? I do<br /><br />    gitk HEAD...MERGE_HEAD &lt;conflicting file&gt;<br /><br />and then with the MAINTAINERS file, I literally see *all* those<br />hundreds of changes.<br /><br />You can just do<br /><br />    gitk v4.12.. MAINTAINERS<br /><br />with the current tree to get a feel for it.  It's just nasty. Now<br />imagine that you have to find the two commits that clash among the<br />100+ commits that have absolutely nothing to do with those two.<br /><br />If we split the MAINTAINER file up, I might still get the exact same<br />number of conflicts, but when I look at the history of the individual<br />files, it will be much saner. That's particularly true if we split up<br />by "first word" (eg "ADAPTEC" or "ARM" or "SECURITY" or whatever),<br />when instead of having tens of different development threads that all<br />end up touching one single MAINTAINERS file (with most of it being<br />entirely irrelevant to one particular conflict), you presumably have<br />just a very small handful (and those are now likely much more relevant<br />to the conflict at hand).<br /><br />Basically, handling four (or whatever) conflicts per merge window is<br />nothing. But they are particularly _annoying_ conflicts.<br /><br />(They are never actually _hard_ conflicts, or very meaningful either.<br />They are just annoying and frustrating exactly because they are so<br />pointlessly much harder to find than they really should need to be).<br /><br />                         Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
