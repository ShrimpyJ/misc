Do you want to show it in<br />the system timezeone? Do you want to always show the full resolution,<br />or do you want to show something that takes the previous log entry<br />into account, so it only shows the date if it has actually changed,<br />and maybe shows the time as just a delta if it is small?<br /><br />Because now it's clearly about the freeflowing _text_, not about the<br />timestamp that is processed by tools.<br /><br />The text field done by print_time() really is _that_ different from<br />the timestamp field that is exposed to tools.<br /><br />Yes, somebody might still be parsing it, and maybe then you need to<br />set that text field to a legacy format anyway, but at least it's a<br />whole lot easier to explain what's going on.<br /><br />                 Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
