That's the "freeform" string part of<br />dmesg.<br /><br />People clearly never actually connected the dots, and noticed that<br />msg_print_ext_header() thing, which is part of the logging format, and<br />which has a different format and that is actually parsed by tools.<br /><br />So you guys screwed that up.<br /><br />Now, if the developers don't know or understand that, how do you<br />expect some poor random MIS person who builds the kernel or sets<br />things up to know?<br /><br />Basically, the whole choice is something that shouldn't exist.<br /><br />If Andoid wants real-time oin the system logs as part of<br />"print_time()", then that is one thing. But doing it this way is<br />BROKEN.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />If you want wall-clock time in the print_time() header, do *THAT*.<br />Don't screw up ts_nsec without understanding how it is used.<br /><br />Really.  Do you really want to argue about this, when the patch<br />clearly shows that the developers didn't understand the code?<br /><br />Comprende?<br /><br />So just admit that the patch series was done entirely the wrong way<br />around, instead of making excuses for broken crap.<br /><br />And then maybe you can send a single patch that changes *ONLY*<br />print_time(), with an explanation of how Android uses<br />CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME and would like that to be realtime instead of the<br />monotonic clock that we traditionally use.<br /><br />See? Fix the part you actually want to fix, instead of breaking the<br />parts THAT YOU DIDN'T EVEN UNDERSTAND OR KNOW OF!<br /><br />               Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
