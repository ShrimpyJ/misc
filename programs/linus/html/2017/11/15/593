If the firmware logs any data and it is<br />&gt; propagated, we run into issues trying to triage firmware, kernel and user<br />&gt; space temporal activities as each is on a different timebase.<br /><br />So I agree with all of this, but I wonder what actuall yuses that<br />BOOTTIME to make it worth even synchronizing with.<br /><br />I'm assuming it's some evdev user.<br /><br />But I'm wondering if perhaps we could just simplify our own lives and<br />make CLOCK_BOOTTIME and CLOCK_MONOTONIC just be the same.<br /><br />And we'd make them be the same by making CLOCK_MONOTONIC act like<br />CLOCK_BOOTTIME.<br /><br />I doubt anybody would notice.<br /><br />At least we could _try_ that kind of system clock simplification.<br />Maybe people would scream bloody murder and we'd have to revert, but<br />wouldn't it be lovely to simplify the synchronization problem by just<br />making it go away (well, at least for the BOOTTIME/MONOTONIC case).<br /><br />So I'd prefer that kind of "could we at least first try to improve on<br />the situation" over adding more complexity due to a historical<br />accident that people at the time didn't think would be so confusing..<br /><br />I suspect a lot of people use CLOCK_MONOTONIC because it's<br /><br /> (a) been around forever<br /><br /> (b) is quicker than realtime<br /><br /> (c) is monotonic (duh!) so you can sort things<br /><br />but these users wouldn't _mind_ getting the BOOTTIME behavior. So<br />making CLOCK_MONOTONIC just do the BOOTTIME thing likely wouldn't<br />hurt.  They don't care about suspend.<br /><br />In contrast, the people who now use BOOTTIME, probably use it exactly<br />_because_ they care about suspend, and may still want the<br />monotonicity, but they'd like something that still approaches wall<br />clock time at least in the _delta_.<br /><br />So I'm pushing back on complexity here a bit. We *might* be able to<br />really just simplify things.<br /><br />         Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
