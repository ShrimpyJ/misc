We've had more than a quarter century<br />_without_ those rules, you don't then suddenly walz in and say "oh,<br />everbody must do this, and if you haven't, we will kill the kernel".<br /><br />The fact that you "introduced the fallback mode" late in that series<br />just shows HOW INCREDIBLY BROKEN the series started out.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />As a security person, you need to repeat this mantra:<br /><br />  "security problems are just bugs"<br /><br />and you need to _internalize_ it, instead of scoff at it.<br /><br />The important part about "just bugs" is that you need to understand<br />that the patches you then introduce for things like hardening are<br />primarly for DEBUGGING.<br /><br />I'm not at all interested in killing processes. The only process I'm<br />interested in is the _development_ process, where we find bugs and fix<br />them.<br /><br />As long as you see your hardening efforts primarily as a "let me kill<br />the machine/process on bad behavior", I will stop taking those shit<br />patches.<br /><br />I'm deadly serious about this.<br /><br />Some security people have scoffed at me when I say that security<br />problems are primarily "just bugs".<br /><br />Those security people are f*cking morons.<br /><br />Because honestly, the kind of security person who doesn't accept that<br />security problems are primarily just bugs, I don't want to work with.<br />If you don't see your job as "debugging first", I'm simply not<br />interested.<br /><br />So I think the hardening project needs to really take a good look at<br />itself in the mirror.<br /><br />Because the primary focus should be "debugging". The primary focus<br />should be "let's make sure the kernel released in a year is better<br />than the one released today".<br /><br />And the primary focus right now seems to be "let's kill things for<br />bugs". That's wrong.<br /><br />And I'm _so_ not interested in that. It makes me go "no, I will not<br />pull that shit, it's not safe for me, and it's not safe for our<br />users".<br /><br />So the hardening efforts should instead _start_ from the standpoint of<br />"let's warn about what looks dangerous, and maybe in a _year_ when<br />we've warned for a long time, and we are confident that we've actually<br />caught all the normal cases, _then_ we can start taking more drastic<br />measures".<br /><br />See the difference?<br /><br />Stop this idiotic "kill on sight, ask questions later".<br /><br />Because it's wrong.<br /><br />&gt; I would agree it would be nice to get at least a subset of this in,<br />&gt; though. Linus, what would make you most comfortable?<br /><br />Right now, the biggest problem for me is that the whole thing makes me<br />uncomfortable, because I think the people involved are coming from a<br />completely unacceptable model to begin with.<br /><br />And we had this exact issue with the _previous_ user mode access<br />hardening. People apparently didn't learn a goddamn thing.<br /><br />                     Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
