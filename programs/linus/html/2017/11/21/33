I don't actually care whether the information is<br />in the signed tag, or in the emailed pull request, or in both. I'll<br />take it either way.<br /><br />There are valid reasons to put it in the signed tag - that way you<br />write it as you do the tag, and then "git pull-request" is pretty much<br />entirely just automation.<br /><br />But some people prefer to do the tag as just a marker (so the tag<br />message may be basically worthless), and then write the explanation<br />later in the email as they send it off. And that's fine too.<br /><br />And yet other people do both - write some summary in the tag, but hen<br />write more about it in the emailed message. And I'll take that too, no<br />problem.<br /><br />And in all three cases I'll edit things for grammar and whitespace<br />(indentation) etc, and may remove commentary that may be interesting<br />for  me doing the merge, but isn't relevant in the history once the<br />merge is done.<br /><br />&gt; I didn't see a clear division between what should go in the pull<br />&gt; request email body and what should be in the tag, this kept all the<br />&gt; information about the pull request together in the tag.<br /><br />There really is no division at all. One common _pattern_ is to have<br />the email message contain more of a freeform message, while the tag<br />contains more of a "summary list", but that's just a pattern that some<br />people tend to use, and it's not in any way universal or required.<br /><br />&gt; Andy's pull request follows this pattern, with the text of the tag<br />&gt; opening with the summary and context relevant to the pull request before<br />&gt; the munged shortlog:<br /><br />Yes, and that separation is fine.<br /><br />But I do want both parts to make sense. If the munged shortlog is pure<br />automation, why send it to me at all? Or if you do send it to me, say<br />that it's just filler for _you_, not for me.<br /><br />But it looks like useful information, but without human editing, it's not.<br /><br />It's basically the difference between "data" and "information". I want<br />information, and if it's pure data that I could get from "git<br />shortlog" that I should just ignore, then tell me to ignore it.<br /><br />         Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
