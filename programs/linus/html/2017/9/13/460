The arguments in<br />&gt;&gt; 06a45a93e7d3 ("firmware: move umh try locks into the umh code") seem<br />&gt;&gt; valid, and there's no real reason to worry about that FW_OPT_NOWAIT<br />&gt;&gt; etc for the direct-from-filesystem loading. That's simply not<br />&gt;&gt; sensible.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Indeed! That stupid UMH lock *seems* wrong on the direct filesystem path!<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Hence these changes.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; The devil is in the details though. That UMH lock however carried an implicit<br />&gt; suspend guard, the "cleanup" actually then has a functional change. The commit<br />&gt; which was reverted provided the safe guard in generic form, in case we already<br />&gt; had become dependent on the suspend guard. This UMH lock on the direct FS path<br />&gt; then added an implicit "arbitrary rule", as you put it, on the firmware API.<br /><br />I still refuse to revert a commit "just because".<br /><br />It improved the code.<br /><br />There is no actual sign that it causes problems.<br /><br />Yes, moving the lock may change behavior, but nothing you say actually<br />makes me think it regressed anything.<br /><br />I refuse to do this "let's just go back to what we used to have,<br />without an actual _reason_ to go back to it".<br /><br />The old user-mode-helper crap was crap that had its own totally<br />separate issues. Even without the problems that we had with incredibly<br />bad maintainership of the user mode side, the usermode helper had<br />serious issues with just the fact that user mode itself is disabled by<br />the suspend/resume process.<br /><br />So getting rid of the locking that was added for usermode helper ion<br />the direct file loading path makes a lot of sense.<br /><br />Just saying that "we tried to re-introduce that locking in another<br />form, and that was a mistake, and got reverted" is *not* a reason to<br />then revert the movement.<br /><br />Yes, the movement of the locking might need to be reverted too - but<br />only if it actually shows problems.<br /><br />We should *not* go back to old code "just because".<br /><br />            Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
