The two have absolutely<br />nothing to do with each other., Reverting one is *not* a reason for<br />reverting the other.<br /><br />Commit 06a45a93e7d34a seems to be a cleanup. The arguments in<br />06a45a93e7d3 ("firmware: move umh try locks into the umh code") seem<br />valid, and there's no real reason to worry about that FW_OPT_NOWAIT<br />etc for the direct-from-filesystem loading. That's simply not<br />sensible.<br /><br />That whole FW_OPT_NOWAIT thing only makes sense for the actual<br />user-mode helper, so that commit actually seems to move the testing<br />and the logic to a place that really does make sense.<br /><br />So why would we revert a commit that makes SENSE?<br /><br />In contrast, the commit that already got reverted, added random<br />locking state logic associated with a callback that didn't actually<br />make any sense in that context.<br /><br />Honestly, what we need here is less "let's do random changes", and<br />more "have actual reasons for those changes".<br /><br />For example, I'm the first to tell people that they shouldn't just try<br />to load firmware from random contexts. If you're bringing up a device,<br />loading firmware might depend on *another* device that hasn't been<br />brought up yet, and you might end up with essentially a deadlock<br />waiting for IO from another device that just isn't going to happen.<br /><br />But we shouldn't fix that by then adding a flag that gets set<br />asynchronously by some random callback, and that then causes a<br />workqueue entry that *could* sleep to just fail. There's no "root<br />cause logic" there. That's the wrong kind of random change. There may<br />be a reason for it in some situation, but in another situation it just<br />fails for no good reason.<br /><br />For example, what might be senseible is to add a warning that tries to<br />verify that people do *not* do firmware loads from the -&gt;resume()<br />callbacks. But then it should literally check *that*: it could do<br />something like<br /><br />         WARN_ON_ONCE(current == resume_thread, "Firmware loading<br />called synchronously during resume");<br /><br />or whatever, exactly because it's obviously *not* ok to block the same<br />process that is going to resume all the other devices that might be<br />*needed* for the firmware loading.<br /><br />But on the other hand, if somebody then does an independent thread to<br />resume their firmware, we could just block to wait for it - it<br />wouldn't be the same kind of chicken-and-egg issue with IO at resume<br />time.<br /><br />So instead of "arbitrary rules", there should be things that actually<br />make sense.<br /><br />The commit that Luis now argues for _also_ reverting makes a lot of<br />sense to me to keep. I'm not seeing why that should be reverted, when<br />the _only_ reason seems to be some spiteful "well, if you reverted one<br />commit, you should randomly revert another one too".<br /><br />               Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
