Fix the printk's instead.<br /><br />In particular, the<br /><br />    printk("bar");<br /><br />could have come from an interrupt, and have nothing what-so-ever to do<br />with "foo".<br /><br />If you want continuations, you<br /><br /> (a) make sure the first one doesn't end in a newline<br /><br /> (b) make sure the second printk has a KERN_CONT<br /><br /> (c) even after that, ask yourself how much you _really_ want<br />continuations, because there are going to be situations where it still<br />doesn't work.<br /><br />I refuse to help those things. We mis-designed things, and the<br />continuations were a mistake to begin with, but they were a mistake<br />that was understandable in the timeframe they happened. But it's not<br />something we should support, and it's most definitely is not something<br />we should then say "oh, you were broken shit that didn't even bother<br />to add the KERN_CONT, let me help your crap".<br /><br />No.<br /><br />Only acceptable use of continuations is basically boot-time testing,<br />when you do things like<br /><br />     printk("Testing feature XYZ..");<br />     this_may_blow_up_because_of_hw_bugs();<br />     printk(KERN_CONT " ... ok\n");<br /><br />and anything else you should seriously try to marshal the data<br />*before* doing a printk(), and not expect printk() to marshal it for<br />you. But for legacy reasons, we do end up trying to support KERN_CONT.<br />Just barely.<br /><br />I'd really like to get rid of it entirely, because the whole log-based<br />structure really really doesn't work well for it (what if somebody has<br />already read the partial line from the logs?)<br /><br />Our printk stuff didn't used to be log-based. It was just a plain<br />character-based circular buffer. Back then that KERN_CONT made a whole<br />lot more sense.<br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
