The last<br />time we did things like this, it was a disaster, because a concurrent<br />reader would see and return the _incomplete_ line, and the next entry<br />was still being generated on another CPU.<br /><br />The reader would then decide to return that incomplete line, because<br />it had something.<br /><br />And while in theory this could then be handled properly in user space,<br />in practice it wasn't. So you'd see a lot of logging tools that would<br />then report all those continuations as separate log events.<br /><br />Which is the whole point of LOG_CONT - for that *not* to happen.<br /><br />So this is just a heads-up that I will not pull something that breaks<br />LOG_CONT because it thinks "user space can handle it". No. User space<br />does not handle it, and we need to handle it for the user.<br /><br />So as long as the kernel makes sure the joining does happen it at some<br />point, it's all fine. It obviously doesn't have to happen at printk()<br />time, just as long as incomplete records aren't exposed even to<br />concurrent readers.<br /><br />A test-case with a short delay in between writes might be a good idea,<br />although the last time this broke it was very clear in peoples syslogs<br />and dmesg because it turns out there are lots of concurrent readers at<br />boot time and _somebody_ will hit the race.<br /><br />             Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
