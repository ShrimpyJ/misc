But my assumption now<br />&gt; is that you have successfully removed one bottleneck, so the tests<br />&gt; get somewhat further and now stick in the next bottleneck, whatever<br />&gt; that may be.  Which shows up as "failure", where the unlock_page()<br />&gt; wake_up_page_bit() bottleneck had allowed the tests to proceed in<br />&gt; a more serially sedate way.<br /><br />Well, that's the very optimistic reading.<br /><br />As the optimistic and happy person I am (hah!) I'm going to agree with<br />you, and plan on just merging that patch early in the next merge<br />window. It may fix a real bug in the current trere, but it's much too<br />late to apply right now, particularly with your somewhat ambiguous<br />results.<br /><br />Oleg's theoretical race has probably never been seen, and while the<br />watchdog triggering is clearly a real bug, it's also extreme enough<br />not to really be a strong argument for merging this out-of-window..<br /><br />&gt; The xhci handle_cmd_completion list_del bugs (on an older version<br />&gt; of the driver): weird, nothing to do with page wakeups, I'll just<br />&gt; have to assume that it's some driver bug exposed by the greater<br />&gt; stress allowed down, and let driver people investigate (if it<br />&gt; still manifests) when we take in your improvements.<br /><br />Do you have the bug-report, just to google against anybody else<br />reporting something simialr&gt;<br /><br />&gt; One nice thing from the comparison runs without your patches:<br />&gt; watchdog panic did crash one of those with exactly the unlock_page()<br />&gt; wake_up_page_bit() softlockup symptom we've been fighting, that did<br />&gt; not appear with your patches.  So although the sample size is much<br />&gt; too small to justify a conclusion, it does tend towards confirming<br />&gt; your changes.<br /><br />You win some, you lose some. But yes, I'll take that as a tentative<br />success and that the approach is valid.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />               Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
