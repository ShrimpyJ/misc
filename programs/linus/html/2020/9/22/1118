You had the<br />"git" but there was no "pull" anywhere).<br /><br />This can be as simple as just adding a "Please pull" or something.<br />Anything to trigger my search terms. Otherwise the pull request<br />doesn't show up when I start doing pulls - I'll see it eventually, but<br />it might end up delayed.<br /><br /> (b) please use an imperative sentence structure for the description<br />instead of present tense.<br /><br />The end result reads _much_ better when you look at the end result<br />after the fact. Just as an example:<br /><br />&gt; Ido fixes failure to add bond interfaces to a bridge, the offload-handling<br />&gt; code was too defensive there and recent refactoring unearthed that.<br />&gt; Users complained.<br /><br />Instead of "Ido fixes failure", please just say "Fix failure".<br /><br />We actually have this in our "Submitting Patches" documentation, for<br />the patch descriptions, but it holds for pull request descriptions<br />too, for all the same reasons. There the example is<br /><br />  Describe your changes in imperative mood, e.g. "make xyzzy do frotz"<br />  instead of "[This patch] makes xyzzy do frotz" or "[I] changed xyzzy<br />  to do frotz", as if you are giving orders to the codebase to change<br />  its behaviour.<br /><br />but the issue is kind of the same. Using present tense in particular<br />is very odd when somebody fixed something a year ago and you go back<br />to the description that says "Ido fixes". No, he fixed things long<br />ago.<br /><br />I basically try to make the commit logs be _roughly_ similar (well,<br />there's basically two kinds of logs: the freeform descriptive ones,<br />and the ones that are a list of changes and use bullet points - and<br />then you have the ones that do both). That also involves primarily<br />just describing the _fixes_ (and possibly the problems). Giving credit<br />to the developers is obviously fine, but if you want to call out the<br />developer, please do it _after_ describing the actual fix. Because the<br />commit log (whether for an individual patch or for a merge message) is<br />primarily about what the change is about. Authorship is separate (and<br />generally shows up as such).<br /><br />End result: I rewrote the above wording into<br /><br /> - fix failure to add bond interfaces to a bridge, the offload-handling<br />   code was too defensive there and recent refactoring unearthed that.<br />   Users complained (Ido)<br /><br />and that's basically would be the form I'd prefer things to be in.<br /><br />Also, I'd love to see signed tags. I don't _require_ them for<br />git.kernel.org pulls, but I do prefer them.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />           Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
