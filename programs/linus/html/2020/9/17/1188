It sure as hell isn't<br />something we should care about performance for, and in fact it is<br />something we should very well warn for exactly to let people know<br />"this process is doing bad things".<br /><br />My main worry is that page_maybe_dma_pinned() not being exact. I'm not<br />entirely convinced whether it really is extremely rare or not.<br /><br />I could well imagine some very fork-happy load having very elevated<br />page counts (exactly *because* it is fork-happy), and then the<br />performance thing might in fact be an issue.<br /><br />That said, you really have to be *very* fork-happy for this to<br />trigger, with GUP_PIN_COUNTING_BIAS being 1024. Those kinds of<br />fork-happy loads very much used to exist, but I think anybody who<br />cares about performance will have long long since switched to<br />threading, not forking.<br /><br />Do people fork a thousand children? Sure. Is it something we need to<br />worry about a lot? I don't know. I'm thinking ot the android zygote<br />disaster..<br /><br />Is there possibly somethign else we can filter on than just<br />GUP_PIN_COUNTING_BIAS? Because it could be as simple as just marking<br />the vma itself and saying "this vma has had a page pinning event done<br />on it".<br /><br />Because if we only start copying the page *iff* the vma is marked by<br />that "this vma had page pinning" _and_ the page count is bigger than<br />GUP_PIN_COUNTING_BIAS, than I think we can rest pretty easily knowing<br />that we aren't going to hit some regular old-fashioned UNIX server<br />cases with a lot of forks..<br /><br />                       Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
