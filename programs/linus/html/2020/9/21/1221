That's kind of what MAP_PRIVATE means.<br /><br />If we haven't written to it, we do keep things coherent with the file,<br />but that's actually not required by POSIX afaik - it's a QoI issue,<br />and a lot of (bad) Unixes didn't do it at all.<br /><br />So as long as truncate _clears_ the pages it truncates, I think we'd<br />actually be ok.<br /><br />The SIGBUS is supposed to happen, but that's really only relevant for<br />the _first_ access. Once we've accessed the page, and have it mapped,<br />the private part really means that there are no guarantees it stays<br />coherent.<br /><br />In particular, obviously if we've written to a page, we've lost the<br />association with the original file entirely. And I'm pretty sure that<br />a private mapping is allowed to act as if it was a private copy<br />without that association in the first place.<br /><br />That said, this _is_ a QoI thing, and in Linux we've generally tried<br />quite hard to stay as coherent as possible even with private mappings.<br /><br />In fact, before we had real shared file mappings (in a distant past,<br />long long ago), we allowed read-only shared mappings because we<br />internally turned them into read-only private mappings and our private<br />mappings were coherent.<br /><br />And those "fake" read-only shared mappings actually were much better<br />than some other platforms "real" shared mappings (*cough*hpux*cough*)<br />and actually worked with things that mixed "write()" and "mmap()" and<br />expected coherency.<br /><br />Admittedly the only case I'm aware of that did that was nntpd or<br />something like that. Exactly because a lot of Unixes were *not*<br />coherent (either because they had actual hardware cache coherency<br />issues, or because their VM was not set up for it).<br /><br />                 Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
