I would attach my resolution, but somehow git<br />&gt; [show|log] didn't show it to me.<br /><br />So when a resolution takes one side over the other (as opposed to<br />mixing two sides), then "git show" doesn't show it as a conflict any<br />more.<br /><br />The reason is simple: at "git merge" time, git figures out the common<br />base, so it has all of "base", "side1" and "side2" to look at and does<br />a three-way diff (for the simplified normal case). So it can see it as<br />a conflict, because it sees both where you came from, and where you<br />ended up.<br /><br />But once you have resolved the conflict and committed the end result,<br />"git show" (and "git log") doesn't do the whole expensive "what was<br />the base" thing any more. "git show" just sees the parents (so "side1"<br />and "side2") and the end result, but doesn't really see - or care -<br />about the fact that some time in the distant past you also had that<br />"base" state.<br /><br />As a result, "git show" doesn't ever really understand the notion of a<br />"merge conflict", and all it shows is really "whee, this end result<br />looks like neither side" as a kind of pseudo-conflict diff.<br /><br />Anyway, thanks for the describing the conflict, it was indeed not<br />complicated, this email is just to explain your "but somehow git<br />[show|log] didn't show it to me" thing.<br /><br />                   Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
