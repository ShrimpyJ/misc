In fact, that's usually a good<br />sign that the code has had testing and is changing things that aren't<br />in flux for other reasons.<br /><br />It's often a good idea to make a test-merge and verify that things are<br />ok, but that's for your _personal_ verification, and shouldn't be<br />something that anybody else sees.<br /><br />And even with a test-merge, it doesn't matter if there is some simple<br />conflict - we have those all the time, and conflicts aren't bad. In<br />fact, they allow me to see "ok, things have changed here in parallel",<br />and I'll be aware of it.<br /><br />The main reason to rebase is if things have changed _so_ much that you<br />really need to re-do things, or if there is some major bug in _your_<br />branch that simply needs to be fixed.<br /><br />&gt;    So I had basically considered it<br />&gt; a no-op rebase. I probably should have explained this in the pull<br />&gt; request.<br /><br />If it's a no-op rebase, thern DON'T DO IT. Really. It just means that<br />now you have lost all the testing.<br /><br />Thinking that it's a no-op doesn't really help. No bugs are<br />_intentional_, I would seriously hope. Lack of testing is lack of<br />testing, regardless of whether you think it would not matter.<br /><br />It also destroys the real history of the code, which is sad.<br /><br />Now, sometimes you may _want_ to destroy the real history of the code<br />(as in "Oh, this history is too ugly to survive, and makes bisection<br />impossible because some of the intermediate state was seriously<br />buggy"). That is then one of those few valid reasons to rebase (see<br />the "major bug in your branch" case above).<br /><br />But 99% of the time, rebasing is bad. If it was in linux-next and<br />there were no horrible problems with it, and it got tested there, then<br />just leave it alone and don't destroy the testing it did get.<br /><br />Anyway, I've pulled this now, but honestly, don't do this again. Stop<br />rebasing without a big and immediate reason, and stop destroying<br />whatever testing it got in linux-next.<br /><br />And if you _do_ rebase, and you _do_ have a real and very serious<br />reason, then mention that reason and explain it. But no "the rebase<br />didn't make any difference" isn't a reason. Quite the reverse.<br /><br />               Linus<br /><br />                   Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
