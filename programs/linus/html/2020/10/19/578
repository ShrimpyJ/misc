It would be OK for RCU to use<br />&gt; preempt_count() for some debugging or specialty kernel, but not across<br />&gt; the board.<br /><br />Right - that was what I thought you were asking originally.<br /><br />I don't think a driver or random piece of code like that should ever<br />use "preempt_count()" on its own - partly because the rules are<br />subtle, but partly simply because drivers have no business with those<br />kinds of low-level things.<br /><br />But yeah, for some core stuff like RCU, using preempt_count() for<br />debugging etc makes sense. Just not to change _behavior_, because<br />preempt_count on its own is almost entirely meaningless. It's just one<br />(local) part of so much state. Again, partly because preempt count<br />isn't necessarily always meaningful due to config settings, but partly<br />because there are just so many other things like "are interrupts<br />disabled" or "are we in an NMI context" or whatever.<br /><br />And in some odd situation, depending on exactly what you do, maybe<br />preempt-count can be exactly what you need, because you know<br />everything else about the state statically. "preempt_enable()"<br />obviously is one such thing - the whole point is "if<br />CONFIG_PREEMPT_COUNT is on, then the _semantics_ of this is 'increase<br />preempt count', and if it goes to zero, and we should reschedule, do<br />that'".<br /><br />So it's not that preempt_count() is meaningless, but it's such a<br />specialized thing that 99.9% of all code really cannot and shouldn't<br />use it.<br /><br />           Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
