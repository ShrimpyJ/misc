I didn't realise you were going by subsystem, so that's<br />&gt; why I was getting worried.<br /><br />My "by subsystem" is a bit fuzzy, and it only really happens when I<br />have a _lot_ of pending pull requests. Which this merge window has had<br />more than most, since usually they come in a bit more spread out.<br /><br />But when I have tens of pull requests in my mailbox, I tend to do them<br />by a very rough "similarity" metric, ie I'll generally bunch up<br />filesystem pulls together, but also pulls from the same person<br />together.<br /><br />So it's not necessarily by any really strict subsystem thing, but you<br />can kind of see some patterns.<br /><br />For example, today I started out with a group of audit and security<br />layer ones (and printk, which doesn't really group with much anything<br />else), then moved through virtualization platforms to some arch<br />updates, and then on to io_uring and block. Which got me to scsi and<br />rdma, and then iommu.<br /><br />Not really much of a logical ordering really, more just me trying to<br />not be _entirely_ random.<br /><br />But the grouping is definitely also about when things come in - I had<br />a different group of security layer and architecture updates on<br />Monday. The ones today hadn't come in yet at that point.<br /><br />By tomorrow, my pending pile has hopefully shrunk so much that I do<br />things mainly by when they come in, rather than have a big pile and<br />trying to do them by some rough grouping.<br /><br />           Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
