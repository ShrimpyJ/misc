Or are<br />you just ashamed of admitting that RH did something stupid?<br /><br />&gt; &gt; compiler to something that works better RSN.  It apparently has problems<br />&gt; &gt; compiling stuff like the CVS snapshots of X etc too (and obviously,<br />&gt; &gt; anything you compile under gcc-2.96 is not likely to work anywhere else<br />&gt; &gt; except with the broken libraries). <br />&gt; <br />&gt; Can you point to things in X which were actually miscompiled because of bugs<br />&gt; in gcc 2.96?<br /><br />I have a report from a Sony VAIO user that couldn't compile the CVS X at<br />all on his picturebook (and you need to compile the CVS tree in order to<br />get required fixes for the ATI Rage Mobility in that machine). I don't<br />know the details, but they were apparently due to RH 7 issues. <br /><br />&gt; So far I was aware about X bugs (already fixed in X CVS) which<br />&gt; were triggered with -fstrict-aliasing which is now the default while<br />&gt; gcc 2.95.2 had -fstrict-aliasing disabled by default.<br /><br />I hope that's another thing that the gcc people fix by the time they do a<br />_real_ release. Anobody who thinks that "-fstrict-aliasing" being on by<br />default is a good idea is probably a compiler person who hasn't seen real<br />code.<br /><br />&gt; That is not to say there were not bugs in the gcc we shipped, but the bugs<br />&gt; which were reported against it have been fixed already.<br /><br />That's good.<br /><br />It's even better if you don't play quite as fast-and-lose with your<br />shipping compiler.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
