People have gotten<br />better at doing cache coherency, and there are people who want to try<br />it. Let them.<br /><br />Yes, I suspect that for true scalability you _do_ want to consider the<br />machine to be a tight cluster. However, I don't think it's unreasonable<br />to do a ccNUMA architecture of, say, 4x4 (four nodes with 4 CPU's each),<br />and use it in an SMP manner.<br /><br />Such a setup doesn't actually _have_ to be expensive - assuming standard<br />chipsets were to come out etc. Remember what made SMP cheap. <br /><br />Let's see what the complexity issues are. I suspect it might work out<br />ok on a reasonable scale.<br /><br />(and once it doesn't scale any more, we'll start treating them as<br />separate machines.  The decision on how to partition it might even end<br />up depending on what kind of load people put on the machine.  Even if<br />you end up using the system as a cluster the cache coherency will at<br />least make some things easier..)<br /><br />&gt;CC is primarily a big deal for user space, for apps pretending they're on<br />&gt;SMP. We don't want to encourage this model as it's fundamentally a bad<br />&gt;match for the hardware.<br /><br />Agreed. But those user applications do exist. Oh, well..<br /><br /><br />&gt;As for the kernel, supporting the two models should be relatively easy<br />&gt;compared to something like adding SMP support in the first place..  We are<br />&gt;already paying close attention to memory-sharing assumptions for<br />&gt;performance reasons and the number of inter-processor primitives is small.<br /><br />Yes. I think it would probably not be all that horrible to have ccNUMA<br />support and then decide to not even use it when the cluster model<br />behaves better. Some of the basic NUMA support is quite simple right<br />now, and we'll see how far we're interested in walking that path.<br /><br />Almost certainly not as far as some have gone.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
