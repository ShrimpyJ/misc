Say 6<br />&gt; months before feature freeze, then a planned 3 month shakedown<br />&gt; (extended only if there are reliability problems). Part of the problem<br />&gt; is that so many new things get piled into each development series. Cut<br />&gt; back on the number of significant things per cycle (say just one or<br />&gt; two).<br /><br />I agree.<br /><br />This was what I wanted for the 2.2 -&gt; 2.4 change too, and a much shorter<br />development cycle would be wonderful. It obviously was not to be: 2.4 is<br />already about 18 months out. We're not as bad as the 2.0 -&gt; 2.2 cycle was,<br />but it's painful.<br /><br />It seems to be a lot harder than it should be to keep short development<br />releases. I certainly haven't found the magic combination yet. 2.4.x is<br />definitely all I hoped for (the big goal for me was to make sure that the<br />mindcraft-like web-performance scalability problems would be gone, and we<br />definitely fixed that), but it took much too long.<br /><br />What would help would be more modular releases: smaller pieces of the<br />kernel getting released independently, allowing for smaller and shorter<br />release cycles. In Linux at least we don't have the "whole world" release<br />issue that most other OS people have (including the free ones: I think the<br />BSD "world" approach is horrible partly because of the release issues),<br />but even just the kernel is so big that it would be nice to be able to see<br />it as multiple independent projects.<br /><br />At the same time it's obviously not true that there are independent<br />projects, and especially drivers (which _sound_ independent) are very<br />likely to be impacted quite a lot by infrastructure changes. There are no<br />really clear lines to split development up by, and the cures are worse<br />than the disease ("microkernels", I hear somebody shout. But that approach<br />would just make it impossible to do the kinds of improvements we _have_<br />done and probably will continue to do).<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
