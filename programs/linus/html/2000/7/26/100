Dont mail me updates, find someone else to<br />&gt;maintain it<br /><br />Note that this part of the status page really is worth some attention.<br /><br />Alan doesn't have the time to maintain 2.4.x issues. Which means that<br />right nobody is really doing it. I have a kind of general "map" in my<br />head, but that isn't nearly good enough..<br /><br />Would somebody be interested in taking this over?<br /><br />Note! It's more than just maintaining a list. It's realizing what are<br />show-stoppers, and what are just problems that should be fixed. It's<br />trying to work with people in trying to get enough information to get a<br />good list of problems, but it's also trying to confirm that the problem<br />still exists or is fixed.<br /><br />It's also possibly maintaining potential fixes: keeping track of who has<br />suggested what fix (possibly with an actual patch). Sometimes the fixes<br />aren't actually usable as-is due to other issues, but even when they are<br />not usable they can be supremely important for people who try to fix the<br />same thing in a acceptable manner.<br /><br />It's also good if you're respected by people already, or at least think<br />you can work with people without making them hate you.<br /><br />In short: it's important.  And it's something that Alan did for both 2.0<br />and 2.2.  Nobody can quite live up to "being Alan", but hey, if you<br />don't like long beards you may be just as heppy knowing that. <br /><br />Anybody?<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
