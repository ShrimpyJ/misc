Mucho Gracias from me and a few (probably<br />&gt; hundreds of people in my workplace) who might want to boot 2.3/4 on these<br />&gt; Dell docking stations (actually we own a few thousand of them, i am just<br />&gt; trying to make sure Linux runs fine ;-&gt;)<br /><br />I bet this will affect just about every single docking machine out there:<br />the bridge in question is apparently the bog-standard "Intel Corporation<br />82380FB (rev 01)". Yeah, National and TI seem to have docking bridges of<br />their own, but I bet the intel one is the most used by _far_.<br /><br />&gt; The proper fix, which is i think what you meant to say is:<br />&gt; <br />&gt; -       }<br />&gt; +       } else {<br />&gt; +               /* Transparent bridge */<br />&gt; +               child-&gt;resource[0,1,2] = dev-&gt;bus-&gt;resource[0,1,2];<br />&gt; +       }<br /><br />Yes. "child-&gt;bus-&gt;resource" doesn't exist. The above is what my<br />drug-addled brain obviously _tried_ to say. It might be more readable in<br />the form<br /><br />	child-&gt;resource[0,1,2] = child-&gt;parent-&gt;resource[0,1,2];<br /><br />which should do the same thing. Can you test that alternative too?<br /><br />I'll go try to find the complete specs for that bridge from hell, but in<br />the meantime I've convinced myself that this might actually be generic<br />enough that I think it's ok.<br /><br />Basically the notion of "transparent bridging" cannot break anything that<br />has been programmed to it's proper address range, so the _only_ thing the<br />Linux use of transparent bridging does is allow these kind sof bridges.<br />Any bridge that has been properly programmed and does _not_ behave this<br />way won't ever see this case, so the change should be safe.<br /><br />Obviously we should be doing a better job of being able to actually set up<br />bridges, and that will probably make all of this a complete non-issue, but<br />for the 2.4.x kind of timeframe I think we'll just face the fact that<br />transparent bridges apparently do exist even if the jury is still out on<br />the exact details on when and whether it is legal from a spec standpoint.<br /><br />[ Some time passes. ]<br /><br />I just checked out the National "Nile II" bridge. It's documentation<br />explicitly states that it can do subtractive decoding etc, and it has a<br />lot more windows than the default PCI bridge thing is supposed to have. So<br />it appears that out of my sample of two docking bridges I've looked at so<br />far, both seem to have deep magic going on that we have no clue about.<br /><br />We should add that information to our knowledge of specific bridges, but<br />the notion of "transparent bridging" would still be the fallback for any<br />bridge that we don't know about (and new ones obviously come out all the<br />time). We simply cannot require that we'd know all the details of all the<br />bridges just to work.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
