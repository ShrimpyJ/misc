Well, at least if not the ultimate cause,<br />&gt; then the penultimate cause.  It's basically yet another truncate bug<br />&gt; (tm).  I have some fairly detailed traces which I can send you if you<br />&gt; like, but the executive summary is that a page can get truncated out<br />&gt; from under us while we are sleeping in lock_page.  The scenario I<br />&gt; observed is this:<br /><br />Sorry, maybe our discussions with Al Viro weren't public, but yes, we did<br />come to the same conclusion a few days ago. <br /><br />The only problem right now is deciding how to fix it - because as you<br />rightly point out, this actually happens in a number of places, and as<br />such it's not trivial to fix it cleanly. We may have to use a brute-force<br />approach for 2.4.x where we just re-test against the file size in multiple<br />places where this can happen - but it would be nicer to handle this more<br />cleanly.<br /><br />There are a few details that still elude me, the main one being the big<br />question about why this started happening to so many people just recently.<br />The bug is not new, and yet it's become obvious only in the last few<br />weeks.<br /><br />I _hope_ that the reason for this is that more people are testing out<br />2.4.x, and that we've fixed most of the other issues that kept people back<br />from using it. It may be as simple as that. But I wonder if there is<br />something else going on too, like the read-ahead being buggy, and that<br />causing the bug to just happen a lot more (if read-ahead is buggy and<br />tries to read ahead past the end of the file, a truncate() will be much<br />more likely to hit these pages past the end, for example. Because most<br />cases of "truncate" are actually about truncating _upwards_, not<br />downwards).<br /><br />So the two worries I have now is (a) the details on how to fix this thing<br />(minor worry, mainly one of aesthetics) and (b) whether there is something<br />else going on that brings it out of the woodworks..<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
