Which can<br />often be as important as the technical ones in the end.<br /><br />The reason? People feel uncomfortable modifying other peoples drivers.<br />This is often true even if the original author hasn't even been a very<br />active maintainer for the last few years. So you find somebody new come<br />in, who cares about the new cards, but is not willing to maintain the old<br />stuff.<br /><br />So he creates a "new" driver that works for him, and in the end he may end<br />up maintaining it a lot better than the non-existent maintenance that the<br />old driver gets. The old driver ends up working with the old cards, and<br />the new one gets the new ones. And in some cases this eventually gets the<br />old maintainer involved again and things work out.<br /><br />Yes, this has happened. <br /><br />And yes, it can go the other way too. It can become a source of painful<br />and unnecessary duplication. <br /><br />On the whole, people tend to _want_ to share, because it ends up being the<br />easier "quick hack" in many cases. So I'm not worried about that part<br />overmuch. I'm worried about people who share even when it doesn't make<br />sense. And I'm worried about people having bad interfaces, which makes<br />even sensible sharing end up as a experiment in horror.<br /><br />That's why I'm so un-interested in the "let's share" argument. I don't<br />think that is where the problems are.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
