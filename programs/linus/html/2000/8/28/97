To pthreads, a thread is a braindamaged stepchild of a<br />process, and cannot do anything on its own.  It's this drooling messy<br />thing that has no life without the parent process that wipes up after<br />it.  It has no spine. <br /><br />In short, threads are not proper citizens.  They are guest workers. <br />Expendable.  Worthless.  They don't have a life of their own. <br /><br />Now, the notion of rfork/clone/sproc "variable-weight processes" is not<br />new per se.  But it's an important _notion_.  It basically says that<br />threads are _not_ the ugly drooling stepson that you really wouldn't<br />want to see at family re-unions. <br /><br />Suddenly, with rfork/clone/sproc, a thread is not just something that<br />you can prod in the right direction with the cattle prod of a random<br />collection of POSIX routines.  A thread is an Idea.  A Notion. <br />Something worthy of a capital letter.  Something you can discuss in<br />mixed company. <br /><br />It's the difference between being useful and being Right.<br /><br />It's hard to explain.  If you have a bent toward physics, it's the<br />difference between a practical experiment and the Unified Teory of<br />Everything. It's the difference between Galileo saying "everything falls<br />at the same speed" and Newton's "F = mMG/r²".<br /><br />If you're religious, it's the difference between "It was a dark and<br />stormy night.." vs "Let there be Light!".<br /><br />If you're into computers, it's the difference between Windows ("sure, it<br />works much of the time, and it looks pretty") and Unix ("everything is a<br />process or a file"). <br /><br />It's like an idea: there are mundane ideas ("hey, let's go out for pizza<br />and a beer") and there are big ideas ("I have a dream..").<br /><br />The difference? The big idea leads to something larger than itself. It<br />makes people think about what the meaning of life is. It gives a<br />_direction_ for where things are supposed to go.<br /><br />In contrast, a small idea leads to other small ideas (fifteen beers<br />later: "I know, let's drive past the police station and moon every cop<br />in the city!"). <br /><br />Ok. I'm overdoing it. But think of rfork/clone/sproc as a way to try to<br />come to grips with what it really means to be a thread. Be one with the<br />thread. Grok the threadedness - so that you can understand what is wrong<br />and what is right _without_ having to count every comma in a standards<br />draft that is 473 pages long.<br /><br />In short, "pthreads" is a rough approximation of the theory of<br />magnetism.  While rfork/clone/sproc is Maxwell's equations.  One can<br />tell you how much force a magnet excerts on a charged particle in<br />motion.  The other one tries to explain how the universe works. <br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
