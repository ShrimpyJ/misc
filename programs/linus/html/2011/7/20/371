So I think we're<br />ok, and I'm planning on doing 3.0 tomorrow.<br /><br />That said, I do have one observation, and two requests:<br /><br />The observation: with the upcoming version number change, the official<br />'git' repository is now (and has been for a week, but people probably<br />didn't notice) just<br /><br />    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git<br /><br />ie the "-2.6" thing is gone. However, the old name continues to work,<br />just so that nothing breaks. You don't need to really change anything,<br />but I thought I'd just point it out.<br /><br />The two requests are pretty simple:<br /><br /> - Please do spend the time doing some last-minute checking of the<br />current git tree. The 3.0 release hasn't really had a lot of<br />fundamental changes, and the pathname bug Hugh found wasn't even a<br />regression - it's been there a while and was in no way a 3.0 thing. So<br />I don't really expect any huge issues, but just for psychological<br />reasons it would be nice to not have even a whiff of the traditional<br />".0 problems" .<br /><br /> - Because the 3.0 release ends up being so delayed from my original<br />plan, that is now pushing the merge window solidly into my summer<br />vacation. Originally, I'd have vacationed after -rc1. With the extra<br />week, the merge window pushed a couple of days into my vacation - not<br />enough to worry about. And now, it's solidly "the second week of the<br />merge window, Linus plans to spend much of the week under water". So<br />please try to send your merge window pull requests *early*.<br /><br />So that second request is basically aiming to not have to extend the<br />merge window. I won't have WiFi under water, and the computer I will<br />have there have won't be doing git merges. But if the load is light on<br />the second week, I may be able to keep up despite being on vacation.<br />Thanks to Intel, I will at least have a very capable laptop that can<br />compile kernels in minutes rather than hours, and where<br />'allyesconfig's are actually reasonable targets for me.<br /><br />If I end up not being able to do a good job while on vacation, I'll<br />obviously have to extend the merge window, but I'm basically hoping<br />that we simply won't need to go there. I just need some help from you<br />guys for that to work.<br /><br />                                        Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
