It's based on something I pushed out this morning, so<br />all the commits are really recent.<br /><br />DO NOT DO THIS. It annoys the hell out of me to pull something and be<br />able to definitely say immediately that the person who wrote the pull<br />request clearly gave that particular git tree zero amount of actual<br />testing.<br /><br />I pulled this time, because I just cannot find it in myself to care<br />too much about mfd.<br /><br />But for the very same reason, next time I notice people rebasing their<br />trees on top of random points, I will just not pull.  If I see that<br />the tree they based stuff on is from the merge window, I'll just go<br />"this guy clearly means for this to get more testing, and meant for<br />this to be pulled in *next* merge window".<br /><br />And it doesn't matter one whit if you say something like "Oh, but I<br />use quilt, so it's been tested there, and I just imported a very well<br />tested tree into -git to push it to you". Dammit, even if you use<br />quilt or something else to actually maintain your patch series, I KNOW<br />DAMN WELL THAT YOU DIDN'T TEST THAT SERIES ON TOP OF THE RECENT CRAPPY<br />NFS PULL!<br /><br />So if you use quilt or something, then import the patch series on top<br />of something STABLE AND SANE. Start off with the released 3.0, that at<br />least doesn't have random pulls that have known compile issues. Use<br />that for testing, and don't send me a re-based patch-series that<br />clearly cannot possibly have been tested in that form, and that was<br />based on a kernel that had ugly problems.<br /><br />(And during the merge window, pretty much any "Linus' kernel of the<br />day" tends to have some problem or other. DON'T USE RANDOM KERNELS FOR<br />YOUR BASE).<br /><br />Seriously. It really annoys the hell out of me when I get pull<br />requests that are totally half-assed. And today I got *two* of them<br />(that NFS pull request that you had based your tree on really was<br />total crap too, and had clearly not been tested enough)<br /><br />I'm grumpy. I don't want to know that submaintainers are sending me<br />untested crap. So if you are too damn lazy to test things, at least<br />make it not so horribly OBVIOUS to me that it's clearly not tested,<br />and that it has clearly not been in -next in the form that you sent it<br />to me. Try to at least spend *some* time trying to make your pull<br />request look competent, ok?<br /><br />But best would be if it was actually tested, and had actually been in<br />-next for a week. That is *especially* true when you send me a pull<br />request late in the merge window.<br /><br />There is *NO* excuse for sending me crap this late in the merge<br />window. If it's not ready at this point, don't send it to me. It's<br />that simple. And yes, Trond, I'm very much looking at you too.<br /><br />                  Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
