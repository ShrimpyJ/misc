IOW,<br />the thing may not be "interruptible" in the sense that we don't allow<br />signals (for all the historical reasons: user programs *should* be<br />able to handle interrupted file accesses since they do happen with NFS<br />if you mount things with "-o intr" etc, but nobody has really dared<br />say that it can happen in general). But we generally allow a signal<br />that kills a process to interrupt a read or write.<br /><br />There may be cases where we don't do the "_killable()" version,<br />though. And filesystems that do their own routines (eg writes on<br />filesystems with logs etc) rather than use the VFS helper ones would<br />be more likely to have that issue.<br /><br />Of course, we already say "screw posix" if somebody tries to write<br />really big chunks, and the VFS layer will say "I will truncate writes<br />bigger than 2GB, and better handle partial writes if you do big<br />chunks". That's partly due to security issues with drivers/filesystems<br />with overflow issues, and partly just because anything else would be<br />crazy. We could easily also say that "big writes are always<br />interruptible", for some random definition of "big" (ie<br />multi-megabyte). Exactly because of the DoS issues.<br /><br />                         Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
