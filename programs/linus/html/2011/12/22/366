We probably should just bite the bullet and fix it. EINVAL is<br />&gt;&gt; never the right return value (unless the per-ioctl arguments<br />&gt;&gt; themselves are invalid, not for bad ioctls).<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Makes a lot of sense and I was wondering about it myself, but I'm not sure<br />&gt; stable would accept that.<br /><br />Again, I think it's something we should do during the merge window<br />(early at that).<br /><br />It really has come up several times, it just always comes up at the<br />wrong moment. If you remind me after the 3.2 release, I'll make sure<br />to "just do it", and we'll see if anything break.<br /><br />I doubt anything will, because ENOTTY really is the correct error<br />return (to user space - for traditional reasons) for "no such ioctl".<br /><br />Inside the kernel we generally want to use ENOIOCTLCMD, which is much<br />better named - and thus avoids the confusion that some people have<br />about the ENOTTY name - and that also has the whole "let's just try<br />another approach one then".<br /><br />&gt;&gt; The EINVAL return comes from some people who didn't understand that<br />&gt;&gt; ENOTTY means "no such ioctl" despite the name.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; I did. :)<br /><br />I suspect most people who have used Unix for a long time kind of take<br />the "ENOTTY - no such ioctl" thing for granted and don't even think<br />about it, but we do have a lot of people who write drivers etc and<br />that started with Linux, and I can understand why they think "ENOTTY"<br />is an odd name for a SCSI device driver to use.<br /><br />                Linus<br />--<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
