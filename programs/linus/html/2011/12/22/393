I haven't tested the patch, but just<br />reading it, I'd expect it to break that.<br /><br />And that's the *natural* way to eject a mounted device. Look at the<br />USB memory sticks you have. They are almost all partitioned to have<br />one partition, and that one partition doesn't cover the whole device.<br />And it's that one partition you use to interact with it - it's what<br />you mount, and what you eject.<br /><br />Breaking things like that is not an option. It's stuff people do every<br />day. And there may be some very non-obvious reason that I don't see<br />why it's not broken by this patch-series, but that's the kind of thing<br />that I worry about.<br /><br />And I worry about it a *lot* more than I worry about some broken<br />virtualization setup where you have system engineers that could patch<br />their own kernel if they feel strongly about this. We simply<br />*must*not* break things.<br /><br />I absolutely do not get the feeling that this has been tested so much<br />and is so obvious that there is no risk of breakage.<br /><br />I suspect one thing that would be reasonable would be to just say<br />"Root can do any ioctl's he damn well wants on a partial device". That<br />would make me worry much less about the "normal" setup breaking where<br />you don't give regular users direct access to partitions to begin<br />with.<br /><br />But even that might not work reliably. Maybe the system deamon that<br />actually does the eject (when a normal user does an eject) has been<br />setguid to 'disk' instead, and isn't root. I don't know. I doubt you<br />know either.  Maybe some of them have fallback code to find the parent<br />device. Do you know? Do you know that all do? I doubt it.<br /><br />                          Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
