It also makes me wonder if the authorship is properly<br />attributed.<br /><br />Some of these things are signed off by Linas Vepstas. In fact, some of<br />them are *only* signed off on by him, not by you. Which is definitely<br />wrong. But it makes me wonder if the authorship is buggered up, and<br />those patches maybe should have a "From: Linas Vepstas<br />&lt;linas&#64;codeaurora.org&gt;" on them too.<br /><br />Example of this: "[PATCH v5 12/36] Hexagon: Export ksyms defined in<br />assembly files." (but 13/36, 31/36 and 36/36 were that way too).<br /><br />Others are signed off by both Linas Vepstas and you, but in an odd<br />order. Since you're sending them to me, I'd expect your sign-off to be<br />last, but it isn't. So the sign-off sequence makes it look like they<br />were sent by Linas, even though I got them from you.<br /><br />So I'd like some clarification on this, and I do need *your* sign-off<br />on them all since you're sending them to me.<br /><br />You don't have to re-send, but you do have to explain whether perhaps<br />Linas should be author (and why the odd order of sign-offs) and<br />basically do a "yeah, I sign off on those patches" with a full listing<br />of the patches in question so that I have it for the record.<br /><br />                       Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
