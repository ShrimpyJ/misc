It's how I came up with my current pet theory.<br /><br />But I don't actually have enough sane numbers to make it much more<br />than a cute pet theory. It *might* explain why you see tons of kswap<br />time and bad lock contention where it didn't use to exist, but ..<br /><br />I can't recreate the problem, and your old profiles were bad enough<br />that they aren't really worth looking at.<br /><br />&gt; Except they *aren't broken*. They are simply *less accurate* than<br />&gt; they could be.<br /><br />They are so much less accurate that quite frankly, there's no point in<br />looking at them outside of "there is contention on the lock".<br /><br />And considering that the numbers didn't even change when you had<br />spinlock debugging on, it's not the lock itself that causes this, I'm<br />pretty sure.<br /><br />Because when you have normal contention due to the *locking* itself<br />being the problem, it tends to absolutely _explode_ with the debugging<br />spinlocks, because the lock itself becomes much more expensive.<br />Usually super-linearly.<br /><br />But that wasn't the case here. The numbers stayed constant.<br /><br />So yeah, I started looking at bigger behavioral issues, which is why I<br />zeroed in on that zone-vs-node change. But it might be a completely<br />broken theory. For example, if you still have the contention when<br />running plain 4.7, that theory was clearly complete BS.<br /><br />And this is where "less accurate" means that they are almost entirely useless.<br /><br />More detail needed. It might not be in the profiles themselves, of<br />course. There might be other much more informative sources if you can<br />come up with anything...<br /><br />               Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
