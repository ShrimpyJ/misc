It's been there for decades. Why are you<br />arguing for stupidly removing it now?<br /><br />&gt; I am confused, how can anybody _rely_ on GFP_NOWAIT to succeed?<br /><br />You can't (except perhaps during bootup).<br /><br />BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A FALLBACK, AND SHOW THAT YOU ARE *AWARE* THAT<br />YOU CAN"T RELY ON IT.<br /><br />Christ. What's so hard to understand about this?<br /><br />And no, GFP_NOWAIT is not special. Higher orders have the exact same<br />issue. And they too need that __GFP_NOWARN to show that "yes, I know,<br />and yes, I have a fallback strategy".<br /><br />Because that warning shows real bugs. Seriously. We had fix for this<br />pending for 4.10 already (nfsd just blithely assuming it can do big<br />allocations).<br /><br />So stop the idiotic arguments. The whole point is that lots of people<br />don't think about allocations failing (and NOWAIT and friends do not<br />change that ONE WHIT), and __GFP_NOWARN is there exactly to show that<br />you thought about them.<br /><br />The warning _has_ been useful. We're not hiding it by default, because<br />that makes the whole warning pointless.<br /><br />Really.<br /><br />                Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
