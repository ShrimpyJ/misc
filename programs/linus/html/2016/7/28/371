No excuses.<br /><br />We were there at 4.6 for me with an "allmodconfig" build.<br /><br />In 4.7, we had over a hundred lines of warnings. That is SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE.<br /><br />And the new warnings were actually not so much due to new code in 4.7,<br />as the fact that in between I did a user-space upgrade, and gcc 6.1.1<br />has regressed to the point of the warnings being an unusable mess.<br /><br />&gt; But over the last couple of years I think we probably had hundreds of bugs avoided<br />&gt; due to the warning (both at the development and at the integration stage) - and<br />&gt; now we are upset about a dozen residual warnings and declare it's all crap?<br /><br />Nobody fixed the warnings, and looking at them, they were largely<br />unfixable without making the code worse.<br /><br />Complain to the gcc people.<br /><br />Remember: zero warnings.<br /><br />&gt; I am happy to bash GCC's cavalier attitude to warnings any day of the week, but<br />&gt; this argumentation for this particular option looks fishy to me.<br /><br />It has nothing to do with "that particular option".  It has everything<br />to do with bad warnings in general.<br /><br />Also, if you actually look at the patch, you'll see that that option<br />has already been disabled for a _lot_ of configurations because it was<br />already bad for most cases.<br /><br />&gt; Why cannot we say something like:<br />&gt;<br />&gt;  "a false_positive/false_negative ratio above 10% is considered obnoxious and<br />&gt;   won't be tolerated."<br /><br />Sure. I'm happy to do that.<br /><br />What part of "100% of all the warnings were false positives, and won't<br />be tolerated" did you not get?<br /><br />Once we get to the point that the warning is no longer useful, and is<br />more pain than gain, it gets disabled.<br /><br />If you open a bugzilla and the gcc people actually react to it, we can<br />revisit it. But as it is, that warning had largely been disabled for<br />other configurations anyway, and I just made it go away entirely.<br /><br />Because false positives that we can't fix without making the code<br />worse are not acceptable.<br /><br />                 Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
