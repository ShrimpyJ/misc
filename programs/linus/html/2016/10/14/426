I don't really mind much one way or<br />the other. But what I don't want in *either* the tag *or* the email<br />message is just some automated list of all the commits.<br /><br />(Except for the shortlog itself, I mean. I obviously want *that*<br />automated list of commits in the email, together with the expected<br />diffstat)<br /><br />I actually think that from a first approximation, James Bottomley's<br />approach is a good starting point. Why? Because if you think of the<br />email as something that you send to me to explain why I should pull<br />and what I get, your email summary text is likely all I really want.<br /><br />The people who put the message in the tag have often started out that<br />way, and then they get to the point where they just automate the pull<br />request thing by just writing a message _once_ (for the tag), and have<br />it automatically show up in the email body.<br /><br />So I don't actually care much where the text is. I do want the email<br />itself to have the summary explanation (so that I can see what you are<br />talking about _before_ I even fetch the tag), but it's ok if the tag<br />has some extra summary detail in it, or if the tag has just the same<br />summary as the email, or if the tag has basically nothing at all and<br />ends up being used only for signing purposes.<br /><br />What I *do* care about is that the explanation is an *explanation*.<br />For *humans*. It's an explanation for me ("Why should I pull?") but<br />it's also an explanation for the future ("What goes into the merge<br />message?").<br /><br />Btw, many people explain things like expected merge conflicts etc, and<br />those I usually don't put in the merge message simply because they no<br />longer make sense after the merge is already done. So the "for me" and<br />"for the merge message" is not always the exact same thing, but to a<br />close approximation the two are often very similar.<br /><br />And I do end up always editing the merge message. So in no case do I<br />blindly take whatever you send me. Sometimes the editing is very<br />minimal, sometimes I end up having to do major editing for typos or<br />layout or something. But there is no automated "turn the email and tag<br />into a merge message".<br /><br />                Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
