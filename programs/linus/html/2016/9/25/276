I was under the impression it<br />&gt; encodes like that whenever it sees a utf-8 character in a commit...<br /><br />Yes. But it assumes that the commit text was in UTF-8 too. So I<br />suspect it happened as you were writing the commit message:<br /><br />&gt; I turned off utf-8 support in vim on the machine I write all my code<br />&gt; on<br /><br />I guess that's probably it. You probably had vim try to convert it to<br />latin1 or something, and the odd utf-8 tick/back-tick thing doesn't do<br />so cleanly, so..<br /><br />&gt;- I got sick of stupid stray marks in my code, digraphs being<br />&gt; composed when I just want to replace a single character, git sending<br />&gt; patches in utf-8 encoding because I copied a SoB with a utf-8<br />&gt; character in the name, etc....<br /><br />Hmm. Generally, the only place we should have non-us-ascii tensd to be<br />exactly those names. But a sane editor should "just work" and not do<br />odd crazy digraph crap or things like that. But I don't use vim, so I<br />don't know what the magic incantation for sanity there is.<br /><br />&gt; 7 characters, 12 characters, whatever. Neither make any sense in<br />&gt; commit messages by themselves without the short description that<br />&gt; goes along with the hash.....<br /><br />No, I agree, the right format for describing a commit tends to be<br />along the lines of<br /><br />  .. commit %h ("%s") ..<br /><br />exactly like you did.  It's just that with 12 characters in the hex<br />format, people will still be able to cut-and-paste the hash into git<br />to get the full commit details even a year from now. With just 7 hex<br />digits, you may well end up in the situation where you do<br /><br />    git show e23d415<br /><br />and git says<br /><br />    error: short SHA1 e23d415 is ambiguous.<br />    fatal: ambiguous argument 'e23d415': unknown revision or path not<br />in the working tree.<br /><br />(it's not ambiguous today, but in a year or two it quite possibly will be).<br /><br />It's not impossible to figure out the different possible ambiguous<br />commits, but it's just inconvenient.<br /><br />Right now, of the roughly 618,000 commits in the mainline tree, about<br />98% can be uniquely represented with 7 hex digits. But about 2% o<br />commits need eight or more hex digits to be unique (the git ID space<br />includes all the tree and blob objects too, so the uniqueness is not<br />just "unique within commits", but any kernel git object).<br /><br />                Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
