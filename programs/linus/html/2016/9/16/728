IOW, Sam in his bugzilla report clearly found the<br />system messages with<br /><br />    Sep 10 07:38:23 shorty systemd-coredump: Process 1651 (named) of<br />user 25 dumped core.<br /><br />but for some reason never noticed the kernel saying (quoting Jason):<br /><br />   mmap: named (593): VmData 27566080 exceed data ulimit 20971520.<br />Update limits or use boot option ignore_rlimit_data<br /><br />at the same time.<br /><br />Ok, the kernel only says it *once*. Maybe Sam had it in his logs, but<br />didn't notice the initial failure (which would have had the kernel<br />message too), and he then looked at the logs for when he tried to<br />re-start.<br /><br />Or maybe the system logs don't have those kernel messages, which would<br />be a disaster.<br /><br />So maybe we should just change the "pr_warn_once()" into<br />"pr_warn_ratelimited()", except the default rate limits for that are<br />wrong (we'd perhaps want something like "at most once every minute" or<br />similar, while the default rate limits are along the lines of "max 10<br />lines every 5 _seconds_").<br /><br />Sam, do you end up seeing the kernel warning in your logs if you just<br />go back earlier in the boot?<br /><br />                    Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
