If this looks ok, would you be willing to apply it?<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt; Looks good to me. Did you test the size verification with some made-up cases?<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Yep.  And I tested all the other edge cases that occurred to me.<br /><br />Hmm. So I tested it a bit, and I found a few issues..<br /><br /> (1) actual bug: you really need the "-W" flag to 'readelf'. Otherwise<br />it will truncate the lines to fit in 80 columns, which in turn limits<br />symbol names to 25 characters or something like that.<br /><br /> (2) usability: I have been known to want to look up multiple symbols.<br />So could we support a syntax like<br /><br />       /scripts/faddr2line vmlinux function1+15/226 other_fn_name+32/128<br /><br />     or something like that?<br /><br /> (3) noise: I have to say that it seems to work really well, but the<br />"skipping" messages are a bit verbose.<br /><br />     I guess they practically never actually *trigger*, but<br /><br />     [torvalds&#64;i7 linux]$ ./scripts/faddr2line vmlinux type_show+0x10/45<br />     skipping type_show address at 0xffffffff81023690 due to size<br />mismatch (45 != 166)<br />     skipping type_show address at 0xffffffff811894f0 due to size<br />mismatch (45 != 41)<br />     /home/torvalds/v2.6/linux/drivers/video/backlight/backlight.c:213<br />     skipping type_show address at 0xffffffff814e9340 due to size<br />mismatch (45 != 119)<br />     skipping type_show address at 0xffffffff8157a080 due to size<br />mismatch (45 != 50)<br />     skipping type_show address at 0xffffffff815bbeb0 due to size<br />mismatch (45 != 38)<br />     skipping type_show address at 0xffffffff815ea8c0 due to size<br />mismatch (45 != 35)<br />     skipping type_show address at 0xffffffff8162c650 due to size<br />mismatch (45 != 40)<br />     skipping type_show address at 0xffffffff8162f910 due to size<br />mismatch (45 != 38)<br />     skipping type_show address at 0xffffffff81694ec0 due to size<br />mismatch (45 != 26)<br /><br />     it's almost hard to pick out the case that succeeded from all the<br />noise from the ones that didn't.<br /><br /> (4) ambiguous "inlining" vs "multiple possible cases":<br /><br />     [torvalds&#64;i7 linux]$ ./scripts/faddr2line vmlinux free+15/36<br />     /home/torvalds/v2.6/linux/./include/crypto/algapi.h:302<br />     /home/torvalds/v2.6/linux/crypto/lrw.c:377<br />     /home/torvalds/v2.6/linux/./include/crypto/algapi.h:302<br />     /home/torvalds/v2.6/linux/crypto/xts.c:334<br /><br />     That's actually two different cases, both of which inline<br />crypto_instance_ctx(), and both of which are really the exact same<br />code (just lrw vs xts), so they have the same name and size.<br /><br /> (5) I'd love for the pathnames to be shown relative to the root of the project<br /><br />And (1) is trivial to fix (use "-Ws" instead of "-s" to readelf).<br /><br />I don't think (2) is a huge deal, but I suspect it wouldn't be nasty<br />to do by just using a shell function and iterating over the<br />arguments..<br /><br />But (3) might be a "don't care, it's so unusual as to not be an<br />issue", although it might also be a case of "maybe we should only show<br />the mismatches if there are *no* matches, or if teh user specified<br />verbose output with '-v' or something"<br /><br />I think (4) is worth fixing. Maybe by simply outputting the function<br />name/offset/size again for each hit, which is something you'd need to<br />do for (2) anyway, so that the above case would become<br /><br />     [torvalds&#64;i7 linux]$ ./scripts/faddr2line vmlinux free+15<br />     vmlinux free+15/36:<br />     /home/torvalds/v2.6/linux/./include/crypto/algapi.h:302<br />     /home/torvalds/v2.6/linux/crypto/lrw.c:377<br />     vmlinux free+15/36:<br />     /home/torvalds/v2.6/linux/./include/crypto/algapi.h:302<br />     /home/torvalds/v2.6/linux/crypto/xts.c:334<br /><br />(Note how I didn't give the size on the command line, but the printout<br />showed it anyway).<br /><br />And finally, I suspect (5) is not reasonably fixable. Oh well. It<br />would require some kind of "figure out the largest common prefix of<br />all the filenames in the whole object file". So I'm *not* talking<br />about just passing "--basenames" to addr2line.<br /><br />Hmm. Maybe looking up the "DW_AT_comp_dir" tag in the debug info would<br />work? And just stripping that off?<br /><br />But on the whole, this is really nice. I always disliked the stupid<br />addr2line crap. This just looks like we can get *much* better output<br />by tweaking things to what the kernel uses/needs..<br /><br />Would you mind looking at those things? Just (1) I can do myself, but<br />I'm hoping you'd be willing to maybe do a bit more surgery on your own<br />script..<br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
