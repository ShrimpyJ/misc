And 'cpu MHz' means<br />&gt; current frequency. (yep, now I'm using cpufreq)<br />&gt; Anyway, when I measured TSC drift, I killed cpuspeed service and<br />&gt; fixed freq to 2000. ;-)<br /><br />Ahh. I have an idea..<br /><br />Maybe that thing does thermal throttling? <br /><br />Fixing the frequency at the highest setting is actually one of the worst <br />things you can do, because if the device is thermally limited, it will <br />still do the whole throttling thing, but now it won't do it by changing <br />the frequency any more, it will do it by essentially forxing the external <br />frequency down.<br /><br />And that is going to be *very* inefficient. You really really don't want <br />that. Your performance will actually be _worse_ than if the CPU went to a <br />lower frequency. And it might explain the unreliable TSC too, because I <br />suspect constant TSC is really constant only wrt the bus clock to the CPU.<br /><br />The termal throttling thing is a "protect the CPU from overheating" last <br />ditch effort, and because it doesn't lower voltage, it isn't actually at <br />all as efficient at saving power (and thus cooling the CPU) as a real <br />frequency change event would be.<br /><br />And fixing the frequency to the highest frequency in a tight laptop <br />enclosure is the best way to force that behavior (in contrast - in a <br />desktop system with sufficient cooling, it's usually not a problem at all <br />to just say "run at highest frequency").<br /><br />And btw, that also explains why you had so *big* changes in frequency: the <br />throttling I think happens with a 1/8 duty cycle thing, iirc.<br /><br />It's supposed to be very rare with Core 2. Thermal throttling was quite <br />common with the P4 one, and was the main overheating protection initially. <br />These days, you should only see it for really badly designed devices that <br />simply don't have enough thermal cooling, but if the design calls for <br />mostly running at low frequency because it's some thing-and-light notebook <br />with insufficient cooling (or some thick-and-heavy thing that is just <br />total crap), and you force it to always run at full speed, I can imagine <br />it kicking in to protect the CPU.<br /><br />It's obviously also going to be much easier to see if the ambient <br />temperature is high. If you want to get best peformance, take one of those <br />compressed-air spray-cans, and spray on the laptop with the can held <br />upside down (the can will generally tell you _not_ to do that, because <br />then you'll get the liquid itself rather than gas, but that's what you <br />want for cooling).<br /><br />So if you can test this, try it with <br /> (a) cpufreq at a fixed _low_ value (to not cause overheating)<br /> (b) with the spray-can cooling the thing and cpufreq at a fixed high <br />     value<br />and see if the TSC is constant then.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
