Are you <br />&gt; saying that the first entry in the page should be a timestamp?<br /><br />I think the most straightforward model would be that the "head" of the <br />ring buffer (regardless of size in pages) would have that timestamp. <br />Making them per-page is an option, of course, I have no strong opinions <br />either way. The per-page one could have advantages (ie it would give a <br />nice upper limit for just how many entries you have to walk in order to <br />convert an entry into a full timestamp), but I certainly don't think <br />that's a big decision, more of a detail.<br /><br />But if we start out with having the full TSC in each entry, that's easily <br />going to be painful to fix later. If we start out with a delta system, <br />changing the details of where the base is gotten is likely to be exactly <br />that - just a detail.<br /><br />So I'd like the thing to have small headers, and be designed from the <br />start to have small headers.<br /><br />&gt; I will now have a ring_buffer API, which will do basic recording. It will <br />&gt; have two modes when allocated. Fixed sized entry mode where you can just <br />&gt; put whatever you want in (I'm still aligning everything by 8 bytes, just <br />&gt; since memory is cheap). Or you can have variable length mode that will <br />&gt; make the following event header:<br />&gt; <br />&gt; struct {<br />&gt; 	unsigned char length;<br />&gt; 	unsigned char buff[];<br />&gt; };<br /><br />So the only reason I'm not thrilled with this is that I really think that <br />timestamping should be inherent, and at the lowest level.<br /><br />Without timestamping, what's the real point? EVERYBODY eventually wants a <br />timestamp. We added it even to the kernel printk()'s. People want them for <br />network packets to user space. X wants it for all its events. It's one of <br />those things that people never do from the beginning, but that everybody <br />eventually wants anyway.<br /><br />So I certainly don't mind layering, but I *do* mind it if it then means <br />that some people will use a broken model and not have timestamps. So I <br />think the timestamping code should just be there - without it, a trace <br />buffer is pointless.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
