We <br />just don't have the information, and I doubt we will ever have it.<br /><br />As such, there is no point in trying to make it a low-level special op, <br />because we'd _still_ end up being totally equivalent with just doing as <br />regular trace-event, with a regular TSC field, and then just fill the data <br />field with the new frequency.<br /><br />But yes, I do think we'd need to have that as a trace packet type. I <br />thought I even said so in my RFC for packet types. Ahh, it was in the <br />follow-up:<br /><br />&gt; I guess I should perhaps have put the TSC frequency in there in that "case <br />&gt; 2" thing too. Maybe that should be in "data" (in kHz) and tv_sec/tv_nsec <br />&gt; should be in array[0..1], and the time sync packet would be 24 bytes.<br /><br />but yes, we obviously need the frequency in order to calculate some kind <br />of wall-clock time (it doesn't _have_ to be in the same packet type as the <br />thing that tries to sync with a real clock, but it makes sense for it to <br />be there.<br /><br />That said, if people think they can do a good job of ns conversion, I'll <br />stop arguing. Quite frankly, I think people are wrong about that, and <br />quite frankly, I think that anybody who looks even for one second at those <br />"alternate" sched_clock() implementations should realize that they aren't <br />suitable, but whatever. I'm not writing the code, I can only try to <br />convince people to not add the insane call-chains we have now.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
