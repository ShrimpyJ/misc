First, if we have a 27 bits TSC, with overflow every<br />&gt; 33ms at 4GHz, we assume the kernel will _never_ have an interrupt<br />&gt; latency longer than this for correct heartbeat behavior.<br /><br />We do no such thing.<br /><br />Guys, the heartbeat is a _separate_ thing from overflow handling.<br /><br />You don't handle overflow by having a heartbeat that beats fifty times a <br />second just to insert events, just so that the TSC delta would always fit <br />in 27 bits. That would work, but be stupid. It would mean that you fill up <br />your event buffer with uninteresting crud just because nothing happens.<br /><br />Yes, many people want to have a heartbeat (a "Mark" event) every once in a <br />while, but what I suggest is independent of heartbeats, even if it _could_ <br />be implemented that way. What I suggest is simply that when you insert an <br />event, you always read the full 64 bits of TSC (on x86 - others will do <br />other things), and then you insert the delta against the last one.<br /><br />After all, you cannot read just 27 bits of the TSC anyway. You _have_ to <br />read the whole 64 bits, and then you subtract the pervious trace event TSC <br />(that you have in the per-CPU trace buffer header) from that. You now have <br />a delta value.<br /><br />And if the delta doesn't fit in 27 bits, you generate a 59-bit TSC event!<br /><br />None of this has _anything_ to do with interrupt latency. There is no <br />dependency on a heartbeat, or any dependency on always inserting a trace <br />event at least 30 times a second. There's no worry about conversions, and <br />these are all trivial single assembly instructions to do (or a couple, on <br />a 32-bit architecture that needs to do a sub/sbb pair and test two <br />different registers to see if the result fits in 27 bits).<br /><br />The only issue is that if you insert trace events more seldom, you'll <br />always get the extra TSC event as well, inserted automatically in front of <br />the event you explicitly inserted. The tracer doesn't need to know.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
