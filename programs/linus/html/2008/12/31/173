Please pull from<br />&gt; git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/viro/vfs-2.6.git/ for-linus.<br /><br />Al, can you please try to clean up the commit messages? <br /><br />There's tons of unnecessary "[PATCH, v5]" things in those commit headers, <br />and that seems to mean that you intentionally pass the "--keep" flag to <br />git to keep the crap in subject lines, rather than let git clean it up for <br />you.<br /><br />Git by default will try to clean things up, so you literally have done <br />extra work to make your commits look like shit!<br /><br />Similarly, look at commit ef564e5cb82dbadc49949c93d8f7908f58c1016b: not <br />only does it have a "[patch][rfc]" at the head of the subject line (it <br />sure as hell isn't a rfc any more when you've committed it and intend to <br />push it to me!), but the commit message itself contains<br /><br />    Hi,<br />    Comments?<br />    Thanks,<br />    Nick<br /><br />    --<br /><br />in front of the actual message (that commit also lacks a sign-off, btw, <br />probably exactly because Nick wasn't sure it should be applied).<br /><br />Those things make sense when people pass around patches for comments, but <br />you're supposed to clean the damn things up before applying them! They are <br />pure and utter crap if they make it into the git history - they only add <br />distracting noise, and look bad.<br /><br />I can understand _occasional_ cases where you miss something like this, <br />but EVERY SINGLE COMMIT is broken in this series. Some just have the <br />crappy [PATCH] thing, but there are several that have extra email crud <br />that makes sense in an email, but not in a commit message.<br /><br />I pulled it, but after looking at it, I unpulled it again. It really is <br />every single commit that is broken. Even the ones that aren't from emails <br />(they seem to be just your own commits) are broken. Look at <br />4edb9c1f26c7b7ccd39b7e3fe8aee5096786fdee: it has that [PATCH] header even <br />though it's your own commit (so you apparently wrote it by hand), and the <br />one-liner thing (the one you see in shortlogs or in the gitk overview) is <br />just<br /><br />	[PATCH] nfsd races, reiserfs<br /><br />which isn't exactly readable. Why isn't it real proper English, something <br />like<br /><br />	Fix nfsd races in reiserfs<br /><br />which is a properly capitalized real sentence and thus just more readable? <br />And shorter to boot?<br /><br />Yeah, "git shortlog" will get rid of at least some of these things (it <br />will remove the pure "[patch] " prefixes), and yeah, it used to be common <br />to see [PATCH] in the git logs back early on before we learnt how to make <br />things more readable, so it wouldn't _hurt_ to pull. But I decided to <br />unpull just because I don't want to continue to see things like this. <br /><br />And btw, feel free to push the pain downward. If they people who send you <br />patches send bad changelogs, just tell them to re-send with a better one. <br />I end up just always editing the mbox I have by hand in order to fix <br />things like this, but I also make sure that people who send me lots of <br />patches know to send them in the right format where I no longer need to <br />fix things. After a while, the number of messages I need to fix up has <br />dropped dramatically, and everybody is happy.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
