It has almost no bearing <br />&gt; on the actual allocations.<br /><br />And just to clarify - I think that while you get that error for the <br />qla2xxx driver, I suspect that your actual resource tree is all good, and <br />that the PCI allocations were fine.<br /><br />And then the problem you his is now that the driver literally thinks that <br />some other driver already took that resource.<br /><br />The patch I just sent is not actually the patch I think you should do: the <br />proper patch is to just remove IORESOURCE_BUSY from the e820 resources, <br />simply because they are _not_ indicative of a driver already holding on to <br />the resource.<br /><br />Of course, the sad part is that potentially IORESOURCE_BUSY might actually <br />be a really good bit for exactly that - we've had tons of issues with <br />hardware sensors literally having a kernel driver _and_ a system level <br />driver (ie ACPI), and things get confused exactly because there are now <br />two drivers trying to drive the same piece of hardware.<br /><br />But basically, if you have BAR's and the e820 resource areas co-existing, <br />then the e820 resources shouldn't be marked BUSY.<br /><br />Anyway - to just re-cap - you might as well just ignore the patch I just <br />sent out, and instead just avoid doing that BUSY bit to begin with in the <br />"late e820" case. Simpler and more correct.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
