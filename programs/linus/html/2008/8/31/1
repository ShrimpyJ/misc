Now, that's obviously going away <br />(people mostly use USB for most things that Cardbus/PCMCIA was used for a <br />few years ago), but it still exists and with docking stations etc it can <br />actually be even worse (although that's mainly because access to docking <br />stations is much more limited, I suspect).<br /><br />So what used to happen _all_ the time was that cardbus worked fine on 99% <br />of all machines, but then some machines would lock up when you inserted a <br />card in them, or the card just wouldn't work. And the reason was that some <br />stupid motherboard resource (like the ACPI sleeping registers or the LPC <br />control regs) were not done as a normal BAR, so the kernel wouldn't know <br />about them, and the BIOS didn't necessarily even list it because it never <br />mattered with Windows (since Windows has a different algorithm for laying <br />out the bus resources, and wouldn't hit the magic resource).<br /><br />So this is why we populate the resources with everything we can _possibly_ <br />try to find, including hardware-specific quirks (see things like <br />quirk_ali7101_acpi or all the quirk_ich4_lpc_acpi things etc) for finding <br />resources that aren't done by BAR's.<br /><br />And the hardware quirks have generally worked pretty well. I'd love to add <br />some quirk for the RD790 chipset, but I'd like to know what the rules are <br />for it. I know we have some AMD contacts, I wonder if they could give docs <br />(I don't personally do NDA's, but I can do "gentleman's agreements" where <br />I just say I won't spread things further, as long as I can write code <br />based on them. I know other kernel developers do similar things).<br /><br />Jordan?<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
