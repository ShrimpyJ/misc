That's not my point. <br />Or rather, it actually verry much _is_ my point. If you have the mindset <br />that you're looking for excuses why any individual commit is ok to merge, <br />then you don't end up with a coupld of individual commits any more: you <br />end up with a LOT OF CHURN.<br /><br />It's not the individual commits. You're looking at the individual trees, <br />and you're missing the forest. The problem isn't the individual trees. The <br />problem is that there's a metric sh*tload of individual trees, what we in <br />the tree industry call a 'forest'. You're not seeing it.<br /><br />And btw, don't get me wrong - you're not the only problem spot. During the <br />-rc's leading up to 2.6.26, drivers/merdia was actually a _bigger_ <br />problem. I happen to care less about that (the same way I care less about <br />some odd-ball architectures), but I have to admit that drivers/media was a <br />total disaster last time around.<br /><br />So if it makes you feel any better, others have been even worse.  But this <br />networking problem ha been going on for quite a while.<br /><br />So the problem here really is that you seem overly eager to make excuses <br />for individual patches. And if they _stayed_ "individual" it would all be <br />good. But they don't seem to.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
