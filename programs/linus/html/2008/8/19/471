I <br />would be a ton happioer if you could HONESTLY say that every single one <br />was a regression.<br /><br />And the thing is, you cannot. Some of the ones I pointed you to were <br />actually regressions due to _other_ patches you had much too happily sent <br />me after the merge window had already closed).<br /><br />&gt; That's why some other developers are coming out of the woods and<br />&gt; defending me, they don't have to do that, but they do it because they<br />&gt; feel I'm being slighted at least a little bit.<br /><br />Umm. The only defending I have seen was a F*CKING DISGRACE, since nobody <br />apparently had the balls to stand up and admit that the whole problem <br />happened after -rc1 in the first place!<br /><br />In other words, the "defense" was just making excuses for EXACTLY the <br />behaviour I'm trying to tell you shouldn't have happened in the first <br />place.<br /><br />Please. You're still making excuses for this, even after I pointed out <br />that ALL of the problems with the whole loopback driver thing happened <br />after the merge window. <br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
