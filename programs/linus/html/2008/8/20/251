So the "cannot regress" obviously isn't strictly true, but I <br />think everybody understands what I really mean.<br /><br />It should also be noted that the "new driver" exception should only be an <br />issue for things that _matter_.<br /><br />For example, a machine without networking support (or without suppoort for <br />a some other really core driver that provides basic functionality) is <br />practically useless. But a machine without support for some particular <br />webcam or support for some special keys on a particular keyboard? That <br />really doesn't matter, and might as well wait for the next release.<br /><br />So the "merge drivers early" is for drivers that reasonably _matter_ in <br />the sense that it allows people to test Linux AT ALL on the platform. It <br />shouldn't be "any possible random driver".<br /><br />IOW, think about the drivers a bit like a distro would think about <br />backporting drivers to a stable kernel. Which ones are really needed? <br /><br />Also, note that "new driver" really should be that. If it's an older <br />driver, and you need to touch _any_ old code to add a new PCI ID or <br />something, the whole argument about it not breaking falls away. Don't do <br />it. I think, for example, that the SCSI people seem to be a bit too eager <br />sometimes to update their drivers for new revisions of cards, and they do <br />it to old drivers.<br /><br />And finally - the rules should be guidelines. It really isn't always <br />black-and-white, but most of the time the simple question of "could this <br />_possibly_ be just queued for the next release without hurting anything" <br />should be the basic one. If the answer is "yes", then wait.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
