Because now that I see <br />it, I notice that _that_ is the real bug to begin with.<br /><br />That commit really was buggy. NO WAY can you insert the code/bss/data <br />resources before you've done e820 handling, because it may well be that <br />some strange e820 table contains things that cross the resources.<br /><br />So that original thing was buggy, and made x86-64 do odd thigns. They were <br />doubly odd, since x86-32 did it differently (and better, I think).<br /><br />Then, when actally doing the common arch/x86/kernel/setup.c, the commit <br />that does so _claims_ that the common code came from the 32-bit version, <br />but that doesn't seem to be true, at least wrt this thing. The current <br />setup.c comes from the *broken* cleanup of setup_64.c that had been <br />bisected to be broken.<br /><br />And that, in turn, happened in 41c094fd3ca54f1a71233049cf136ff94c91f4ae <br />("x86: move e820_resource_resources to e820.c") which also did "and make <br />32-bit resource registration more like 64 bit.", so it got the bug into <br />32-bit code that had been introduced in 64-bit code.<br /><br />Ugh.<br /><br />So why was then that other broken commit added to paper it over, even <br />though the original broken commit had been bisected and the breakage was <br />known to have been due to _that_?<br /><br />Hmm?<br /><br />Yinghai - I'm hoping that the code movement is all over and done with, but <br />you need to be a _lot_ more careful here. And Ingo, this really wasn't <br />very well done.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
