This new version implements a "single cmpxchg"<br />&gt; uncontended code path, changes the _fast semantic for "trylock<br />&gt; uncontended" and also adds the trylock primitives.<br /><br />Can you also finally<br /><br /> - separate out the fastpaths more clearly. The slowpaths should not be <br />   even visible in the I$ footprint. The fastpaths are probably better off <br />   as a separate "fastpath.S" file to make sure that the compiler doesn't <br />   inline the slowpath or do other insane things.<br /><br />   If the fastpath isn't just a few instructions, there's something wrong. <br />   It should be written in assembly, so that it's very clear what the <br />   fastpath is. Because most of the time, the fastpath is all that really <br />   matters (at least as long as there is some reasonable slow-path and <br />   contention behaviour - the slowpath matters int hat it shouldn't ever <br />   be a _problem_).<br /><br /> - don't call these "fair". They may be fairER than the regular rwlocks,<br />   but you'd really need to explain that, and true fairness you (a) can't<br />   really get without explicit queueing and (b) probably don't even want, <br />   because the only starvation people tend to worry about is reader vs <br />   writer, and writer-writer fairness tends to be unimportant. So it's not <br />   that people want the (expensive) "fairness" it's really that they want <br />   something _reasonably_ fair considering the normal worries.<br /><br />   (ie if you have so much write activity that you get into write-write <br />   fairness worries, you shouldn't be using a rwlock to begin with, so <br />   that level of fairness is simply not very interesting).<br /><br />   People react emotionally and too strongly to to words like "fairness" <br />   or "freedom". Different people have different ideas on what they mean, <br />   and take them to pointless extremes. So just don't use the words, they <br />   just detract from the real issue.<br /><br />Also, the performance numbers on their own are pretty irrelevant, since <br />there's nothing to compare them to. It would be much more relevant if you <br />had a "this is what the standard rwlock" does as a comparison for each <br />number.<br /><br />				Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
