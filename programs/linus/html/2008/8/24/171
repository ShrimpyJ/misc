But is it limited to _that_ particular <br />SATA controller, or just a few ones? Or a generic issue? Without more <br />reports to really find a pattern, I don't think we have a clue, and the <br />two may be _totally_ unrelated in all ways, but it would be good to at <br />least report and log the information you have..<br /><br />Oh, I just noticed that your dmesg _does_ mention sata_sil and sata_via, <br />so we know which of two drivers it would be, at least. Not the nVidia one.<br /><br />However, there's been tons of changes in soem core functions: both the <br />reset handling and the wait-for-ready has changed and caused lots of churn <br />across most drivers in between 2.6.25 and 2.6.26. <br /><br />&gt; PS if anyone really is interested then I am happy to try the bisection once I've<br />&gt; moved her to a new box; otherwise I'm happy to close this.<br /><br />I think it would be good to try to bisect. It could be something that is <br />really just limited to that particular machine (maybe it really is some <br />flaky hardware that just triggers some timing changes), but more likely it <br />isn't. So the more information, the better. So keep the thing open as long <br />as somebody is willing to try to gather more info, by all means.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
