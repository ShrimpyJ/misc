I really wanted to wait with kmemcheck, which is huge and I'm not <br />&gt; &gt; entirely convinced yet.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Any particular concerns?<br /><br />It's big, complex and looks fragile. And it reports lots of false <br />positives, with big warnings to people to generally not use or make <br />reports about itit unless they are already experts. So it looks like <br />something pretty specific.<br /><br />I also want to feel like it actually has been helpful.<br /><br />But the _real_ issue is that I'm simply merging about 20+ trees per day, <br />and I want to know what I merge, and I want to feel comfy about it as I <br />merge it.<br /><br />And kmemcheck didn't make me do that, adn I didn't feel like I had the <br />time to really look at it any closer. So while I might merge it before the <br />merge window is open, there's simply no way I'll merge it today (and <br />almost certainly not this week, considering that I'll be on the coast for <br />a long weekend).<br /><br />IOW, I'm quite busy enough merging _other_ things, and handling the <br />fallout from those other merges (mostly the firmware discussion ;). So I'm <br />simply not interested in kmemcheck right now - I have enough to keep me <br />busy.<br /><br />So kmemcheck in no way made me go: "ok, we _need_ to merge this", and at <br />the same time it's biggish and scary and complex enough that I felt I <br />needed to take the time to think about it - which I don't feel I have <br />right now.<br /><br />The RCU thing, on the other hand, looked like a no-brainer from a merge <br />standpoint. However, since it had merged kmemcheck, it didn't get merged <br />either. I'll take a look at Ingo's second version that didn't tie the two <br />together.<br /><br />This is why tying things together doesn't necessarily work, and why I told <br />Ingo that I'm not pulling the RCU thing just because I wasn't ready to <br />pull kmemcheck.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
