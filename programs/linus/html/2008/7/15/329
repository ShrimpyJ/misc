Those aren't really technical issues, and more <br />importantly, they are not issues that _can_ be solved any other way than <br />just doing it, and fixing the fallout.<br /><br />Trying to be "proactive" doesn't work. Waiting for people (and scripts) to <br />get used to a new model before merging it also doesn't work. And <br />complaining about a change that pretty obviously is needed also doesn't <br />work.<br /><br />So let's just do it. And then, when specific scripts are encountered, fix <br />them. And yes, fixing the scripts may _well_ imply adding more support for <br />it in the kernel. It could be either in build and installation scripts, or <br />in udev infrastructure, or in request_firmware() capability itself.<br /><br />For example, some people hate udev, and they may have some really good <br />reason why they really don't want to rely on that in their setup. So maybe <br />we should teach request_firmware() to try to look up (binary) firmware <br />files directly from the filesystem before it does a udev callback (in <br />fact, maybe it even already does - I really didn't check very closely).<br /><br />None of these are "problems". <br /><br />But people who don't even want to look for solutions - _that_ is a <br />problem.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
