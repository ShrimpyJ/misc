If you are not aware of it, you do<br />&gt; nothing.<br /><br />Well, some people keep it secret and track it on vendor-sec or similar, <br />hidden from us.<br /><br />But then when they are ready to announce it, they want our help to glorify <br />their corrupt process when they finally deign to let us know. And that <br />really irritates me.<br /><br />&gt; All I ask for is to receive the "There are updates available." message as soon<br />&gt; as one security problem is reported, understood and treated by your<br />&gt; development part. And that is, the sooner possible, if you please.<br /><br />Umm. You're talking to _entirely_ the wrong person.<br /><br />The people who want to track security issues don't run my development <br />kernels. They usually don't even run the _stable_ kernels. They tend to <br />run the kernels from some commercial distribution, and usually one that is <br />more than six months old as far as I - and other kernel developers - are <br />concerned.<br /><br />IOW, when we fix security issues, it's simply not even appropriate or <br />relevant to you. More importantly, when we fix them, your vendor probably <br />won't have the fix for at least another week or two in most cases anyway.<br /><br />So ask yourself - what would happen if I actually made a big deal out of <br />every bug we find that could possibly be a security issue. HONESTLY now!<br /><br />We'd basically be announcing a bug that (a) may not be relevant to you, <br />but (b) _if_ it is relevant to you, you almost certainly won't actually <br />have fixed packages until a week or two later available to you!<br /><br />Do you see?<br /><br />I would not actually be helping you. I'd be helping the people you want to <br />protect against!<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
