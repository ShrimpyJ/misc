It was exactly the <br />sort of "subtle cleverness" that I myself argue against. So I think that <br />aliasing of cpu_active/online_map was a mistake - it was kind of cute, but <br />there's really no good reason to do it. It's not like that one CPU map <br />wastes any memory, and the special-case simply isn't worth it.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
