I think pointing it out is<br />&gt; &gt; actually likely to be counter-productive. <br />&gt; <br />&gt; you keep saying that, but you don't explain *why*.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; &gt; For example, the way I prefer to work is to have people send me and the <br />&gt; &gt; kernel list a patch for a fix, and then in the very next email send (in <br />&gt; &gt; private) an example exploit of the problem to the security mailing list <br />&gt; &gt; (and that one goes to the private security list just because we don't want <br />&gt; &gt; all the people at universities rushing in to test it). THAT is how things <br />&gt; &gt; should work.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; fine with me, i wasn't talking about that at all though ;).<br /><br />Oh, so now you're suddenly fine with not doing "full disclosure"?<br /><br />Just a few emails ago you berated me for not doing full disclosure, but <br />now you're saying it is fine?<br /><br />Can you now admit that it's a gray line, and that we just have very <br />different opinions of where the line is drawn?<br /><br />&gt; 1. simple words/phrases that one can grep for (mentally or automated)<br />&gt;    examples: 'security', 'exploitable', 'DoS', 'buffer overflow', etc<br /><br />I literally draw the line at anything that is simply greppable for. If <br />it's not a very public security issue already, I don't want a simple "git <br />log + grep" to help find it.<br /><br />That said, I don't _plan_ messages or obfuscate them, so "overflow" might <br />well be part of the message just because it simply describes the fix. So <br />I'm not claiming that the messages can never help somebody pinpoint <br />interesting commits to look at, I'm just also not at all interested in <br />doing so reliably.<br /><br />&gt; i believe 3-5 are definitely not commit message material. 1 or 2 are.<br />&gt; 5 should never be published or disseminated, 3 and 4 may be distributed<br />&gt; to interested parties.<br /><br />And I believe you now at least understand the difference. I draw the line <br />between 0 and 1, where 0 is "explain the fix" - which is something that <br />any - and every - commit message should do.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
