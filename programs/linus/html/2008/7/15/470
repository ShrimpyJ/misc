If we knew what the details were, we could make the need <br />for education even less, so that it would just work with whatever they do.<br /><br />But yes, if it fundamentally boils down do "you had a script that copied <br />named files by hand", then that script needs fixing. But that's somethign <br />that somebody who compiles his own kernel (especially in an odd <br />environment, apparently) just needs to do.<br /><br />Sometimes build updates need people to fix things. We find gcc bugs, we <br />require people to update. The whole "new kernels should work with old <br />distributions" does not mean that people building the kernels might not <br />have to do _something_ special.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
