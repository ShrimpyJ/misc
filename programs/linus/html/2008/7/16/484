Based on what I've seen <br />&gt; of the x86 tree I don't have nearly enough branches<br /><br />Don't worry about it. Start small. I think the x86 tree took up some <br />pretty extreme limits, as can be seen by their 29-way merge or whatever it <br />was. They also obviously have a lot more stuff going on than the PCI tree <br />would be expected to have.<br /><br />For most people, I'd expect that a small handful of branches is good. It <br />might be just one, but it might be a couple of independent issues.<br /><br />The point where a topic branch is _really_ useful is when you ask yourself <br />whether that particular change is something that you (or somebody else!) <br />might want to delay or test separately from some other change - that's <br />when "oh, let's just use a separate branch for it" is really appropriate.<br /><br />Len, for example, often did topic branches for individual bugzilla <br />entries, and obviously for big conceptually separate things like ACPICA, <br />which really _is_ a totally disjoint development track.<br /><br />Other people, like rmk, use topic branches for particular hardware <br />platforms.<br /><br />On the other hand, if it's a trivial and obvious thing, there's no point <br />in putting it into a separate branch. A number people who keep topic <br />branches for all their major development then end up having a "misc" <br />branch for just random things.<br /><br />And remember: in git, topic branches are temporary things. You can rename <br />them, you can delete them, you can ignore them. And before you've pushed <br />things out, you can even decide to create a topic branch of a set of <br />commits _after_ the fact. So you can commit _first_, and then decide that <br />that commit was probably best to keep separate, so you create a topic <br />branch with that commit on it, an go back to the pre-commit state on your <br />regular branch.<br /><br />BUT!<br /><br /> - Not everybody _has_ to use topic branches. If you are maintaining <br />   something that is very specific to begin with, _all_ your maintenance <br />   is basically one topic to start with, so you'd never have separate <br />   topic branches.<br /><br />   The filesystem people, for example, do not tend to use topic branches <br />   for this reason. They do their filesystem. They seldom have issues that <br />   crop up on just certain platforms etc.<br /><br /> - And more importantly - play around with it. Get used to it first. Look <br />   at what other people do. Start small, with perhaps just one special <br />   topic branch to test the waters with.<br /><br />So don't worry _too_ much.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
