It's been great at catching merge <br />&gt; conflicts and build bugs (though not so much when you don't use it[1]!), and <br />&gt; Stephen is really easy to work with.  So I, for one, would love to see it <br />&gt; continue.<br /><br />I don't think anybody wants it to go away. The question in my mind is more <br />along the way of how/whether it should be changed. There was some <br />bickering about patches that weren't there, and some about how _partial_ <br />series were there but then the finishing touches broke things.<br /><br />I don't personally really think that it's reasonable to expect everything <br />to be in -next (but hey, I'm willing to be convinced otherwise). And don't <br />get me wrong - it certainly wouldn't bother _me_ to have everything go <br />through next, since it just makes it likelier that I have less to worry <br />about.<br /><br />BUT. I do think 'next' as it is has a few issues that either need to be <br />fixed (unlikely - it's not the point of next) or just need to be aired as <br />issues and understood:<br /><br /> - I don't think it does 'quality control', and I think that's pretty <br />   fundamental.<br /><br />   Now, admittedly I don't look much at the patches of people I trust <br />   either (that's what the whole point of that 'trust' is, after all - to <br />   make me not be the part that limits development speed), but that's <br />   still different from 'largely automated merging'.<br /><br />   So I _do_ check the things that aren't obvious "maintainer works on his <br />   own subsystem" or are so core that I really feel like I need to know <br />   what's up. I seldom actually say "that's so broken that I refuse to <br />   pull it", but I tend to do that a couple of times per release.<br /><br />   That may not sound like much, but it's enough to make me worry about <br />   'next'. I worry that 'it has been in next' has become a code-word for <br />   "pull this, because it's good", and I'm not at all convinced that <br />   'next' sees any real critical checking.<br /><br /> - I don't think the 'next' thing works as well for the occasional <br />   developer that just has a few patches pending as it works for subsystem <br />   maintainers that are used to it.<br /><br />   IOW, I think 'next' needs enough infrastructure setup from the <br />   developer side that I don't think it's reasonable for _everything_ to <br />   go through next. And that in turn means that I'm not entirely thrilled <br />   when people then complain "that wasn't in next". I think people should <br />   accept that not everything will be in next.<br /><br />But I don't think either of the above issues is a 'problem' - I just think <br />they should be acknowledged. I think 'next' is a good way for the big <br />subsystem developers to be able to see problems early, but I really hope <br />that nobody will _ever_ see next as a "that's the way into Linus' tree", <br />because for the above two reasons I do not think it can really work that <br />way.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
