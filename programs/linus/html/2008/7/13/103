I think you misread it.<br /><br />Two facts:<br /><br /> - ^Z and ^C are both going to be equally fast if they aren't blocked.<br /><br />   This is just how things are. They are handled by the same codepaths.<br /><br /> - the report you point to does mention 'find', but *not* in the place <br />   where it talks about "^Z+kill". There it's much less specific, and I <br />   bet that Edwin _had_ seen the "^Z works" behavior, and knew it to be <br />   true, but hadn't realized that it depended on the command, so when he <br />   gave an example of something where disk IO makes signals slow, he <br />   happened to pick one where ^Z and ^C were equally slow.<br /><br />In other words, I can pretty much _guarantee_ that if ^Z+kill is faster <br />than ^C, then it's because the process blocked or caught ^C.<br /><br />And I can pretty much also guarantee that when Edwin talked about 'find' <br />and did that ^C cut-and-paste, he didn't try the ^Z thing (that had <br />happened with _other_ programs), or if he did, it was just happenstance <br />(because the latency isn't _always_ 10-30 seconds - that's just the worst <br />case).<br /><br />So yes, ^C often works slower. If the process catches it and removes <br />temporary files as a result (for example - it's what things like gcc do), <br />then of _course_ it's going to be slower. It's going to be very noticeably <br />slower, especially since removing a temp-file is going to be even more <br />likely to hit a filesystem lock if the write-queues are full than just a <br />normal read is.<br /><br />But ^C isn't always slower, and if 'find' doesn't block/ignore it (and I <br />certainly believe you when you say that it doesn't), then for the case of <br />'find', it won't be true that ^Z+kill is any faster.<br /><br />In fact, Edwin later in this thread reported:<br /><br />  "Also I wasn't able to reproduce the  'Ctrl+Z works faster than Ctrl+C'<br />   symptom, perhaps it is just a coincidence: by the time I press Ctrl+Z to<br />   interrupt, enough time has passed (30+ secs), that the same effect would<br />   have been obtained by another Ctrl+C, or by just waiting."<br /><br />and I bet that is exactly because now he's been testing programs that <br />don't block ^C (ie maybe he's now testing _just_ that "find /" thing).<br /><br />So before, Edwin was probably doing random things when doing "normal <br />work", and noticed that ^Z was sometimes faster. Now, he's trying to chase <br />things down, and he creates this specific test-case, and for that <br />particular test-case, ^Z _isn't_ faster. He just didn't pick up on the <br />pattern that it depends on which particular command he works on.<br /><br />Try "yum list", and you'll certainly see that ^Z works a *lot* faster than <br />^C (and the latter often needs multiple ^C's even when there is no load <br />at all)<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
