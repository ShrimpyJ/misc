So you don't need to feel bad about it. Ingo and Thomas <br />obviously did the very same thing not that long ago.<br /><br />And Davem had the same issue in the networking tree - most of the times <br />when I pulled, I could tell that he had _just_ rebased the whole series, <br />and I just knew that it had gotten effectively zero testing in that <br />particular configuration.<br /><br />For other trees it's still ongoing: you can generally trivially tell by <br />looking at the merges and the dates of the commits relative to them and <br />'base' they are done on top of. <br /><br />So you're definitely not alone. There are people who have done the same <br />thing, and in many cases they did it for months. I'll happily try to help <br />you with any git issues, and we can even change git itself to help with <br />some things (historically we certainly have - I certainly hope that the <br />need for it is going away, though). <br /><br />And I can also report that the people who then re-learnt their workflow <br />and got used to maintaining several queues and not always working at the <br />top of the tree and rebasing on top of whatever "random Linus kernel of <br />the moment" (in order to actually work with and test what they eventually <br />ask me to pull!) have so far been pretty enthusiastic about the workflow <br />they learn once they pick it up.<br /><br />And to give them credit for being smarter them me, others (like Jeff) <br />started doing the whole "many different branches" thing long before I <br />personally even realized how helpful it is.<br /><br />And as mentioned, some still use the "queue on top of the most recent <br />version" model, and when it's something fairly far away in the periphery <br />and doesn't impact others, I don't really care. If it hadn't been for the <br />PCI merge bringing up the issue, I'd have ignored the ACPI case too.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
