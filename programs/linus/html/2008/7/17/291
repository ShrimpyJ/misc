I _do_ just drop requests in the <br />bottomless pit that is my mailbox at times)<br /><br />We seem to be roughly half-way through the merge window, judging purely by <br />number of commits, although part of my calculations there is that I'm <br />actually hoping/expecting that because a number of people are on vacation <br />etc, this merge window might be smaller than some of the other recent ones <br />(2.6.25-rc1 in particular was huge).<br /><br />In the last couple of days I _have_ merged 50+ trees, and while there's <br />been some 'heated discussion' about some of them (you know who you are ;), <br />I'm hoping that we're actually in reasonably good shape even though it's <br />in the middle of the merge window, and that people will test out the <br />snapshot kernels even though I'm not ready to do a -rc1 release.<br /><br />So go out and test.<br /><br />The fact that much of it has been in linux-next may or may not have <br />helped, but it definitely meant that people knew of _some_ problems early. <br />Let's see how people feel about that after the whole release is done, but <br />it certainly doesn't seem to have hurt.<br /><br />My personal favorite merge is the BKL pushdown, which while not likely to <br />matter hugely in practice for lots of people is nice to finally see. We <br />kind of dropped the ball on the BKL once it got to be small enough that it <br />wasn't very high on peoples radar any more. Now the most noticeable user <br />of the BKL in "core" kernel code seems to be fs/locks.c.<br /><br />Hint, hint. I think somebody had some patches for that one too. Matthew?<br /><br />But we've had lots of other things (in fact, the BKL changes ended up <br />being much smaller than I expected), and the dirstat so far is<br /><br />	   4.7% arch/arm/<br />	   3.3% arch/mips/<br />	   3.5% arch/ppc/platforms/<br />	  14.9% arch/ppc/<br />	   3.3% arch/x86/<br />	  29.3% arch/<br />	   8.3% drivers/char/drm/<br />	   9.3% drivers/char/<br />	   7.3% drivers/gpu/drm/<br />	   7.3% drivers/gpu/<br />	   3.3% drivers/s390/<br />	  10.4% drivers/usb/misc/<br />	   6.0% drivers/usb/serial/<br />	  17.2% drivers/usb/<br />	  45.0% drivers/<br />	   7.1% firmware/<br />	   4.3% fs/ubifs/<br />	   5.0% fs/<br />	   6.7% include/<br />	   3.3% sound/<br /><br />where some of those percentages are a bit misleading (the "gpu" part, for <br />example, goes away if you enable renames, since that was all really just <br />moving files around from drivers/char/ - but at the same time it's one of <br />the things people may notice more, so I chose the non-rename version of <br />dirstat on purpose).<br /><br />No network or driver core/USB merges yet (the USB stuff in the dirstat is <br />from the ARM, BKL and firmware merges) so there are complete big <br />subsystems lacking still, but it would be good to have people test the <br />things we _have_ merged.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br />PS.
