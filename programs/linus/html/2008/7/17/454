Moving your own commits around to make them make more <br />sense - or splitting them up etc - is often a _good_ thing, even if it <br />obviously does change history.<br /><br />So using rebase to clean up and simplify and/or fix up stupid ordering <br />issues is good, and "git rebase -i" is actually really good for this <br />thing.<br /><br />No, the problems start happening when you do it on a larger scale, or (and <br />this is very common in the kernel), your rebase _moves_ the commits over <br />big distances because you update to the top of my development tree. In <br />that case, while your patches themselves may not have changed, the base <br />that you based them on may have changed really subtly - it still compiles, <br />it still "works", but maybe it doesn't work as well as it used to. And <br />that's why the old testing you did is basically almost worthless.<br /><br />So rebasing can be good or bad. It's a matter of degree. Rebasing private <br />and small things is generally good. Rebasing bigger things can cause <br />problems. And the further away you rebase something, the more problems it <br />will generally cause. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
