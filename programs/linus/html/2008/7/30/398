Note that this is true only for merging (and some operations that can <br />use the merge infrastructure, like cherry-picking). It's obviously not <br />true for pure patches that are just pending in mailboxes etc.<br /><br />The big x86 architecture rename (i386-&gt;x86) had some problems just due to <br />the huge number of files involved, but the include directory should not <br />just be easier, on the git side we also fixed some of the scalability <br />issues we had with lots of renames.<br /><br />[ However, fairly old versions of git may still have trouble due to <br />  limiting rename detection to a smallish number of files (ie 100 or <br />  something).<br /><br />  Note, though, that the only person who needs a reasonably modern version <br />  of git is the person actually doing any merges that take renames into <br />  account. So "normal users" can use old versions without even realising. <br /><br />  And we're really talking about git versions about a year old - the whole <br />  arch/x86 rename thing was June last year. So by "modern" I definitely <br />  don't mean "last week", but "updated in any kind of reasonable manner", <br />  which I assume everybody involved in any x86 merging would have ]<br /><br />&gt; &gt; I missed the discussion on this, what's the point of renaming all these<br />&gt; &gt; files?<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I know there has been talk about this on and off for a long time (to get all<br />&gt; the arch code into arch/).  I don't know if there are any mechanical reasons<br />&gt; for it, on top of that.<br /><br />My big reason is that it makes it much easier for me to see when merges <br />only touch a specific architecture (git will always sort things by <br />pathname, so if the first pathname is arch/xyz/something and the last one <br />is arch/xyz/somethingelse, then I don't even need to look any closer). It <br />also makes it much nicer for my statistics generator.<br /><br />IOW, it helps the "overview" people, probably not so much anybody else. <br /><br />It also ends up allowing some extra flexibility, ie we can put <br />architecture header files in other places than &lt;asm/xyz.h&gt; (eg the whole <br />&lt;mach/xyz.h&gt; thing), so there _are_ technical reasons for it, but at least <br />to me those are just frosting on the cake.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
