So if DCE 1.1 (d) is considered to be legally <br />&gt; required for public indefinite storage of name and email address<br />&gt; we have a problem here.<br /><br />Quite frankly, since the patches are public anyway, and the code is open <br />source, I personally think that worry is just silly fear-mongering by <br />people who take lawyers not just too seriously, but then think that judges <br />and lawyers are too stupid to think for themselves.<br /><br />We added the lines to the DCO-1.1 because we wanted to make it _obvious_ <br />that the legal requirements for the sign-off would never clash with any <br />possible insane reading of things, but it was a "dot the i's" kind of <br />thing.<br /><br />The fact is, people who are involved in Linux know it's public. People <br />make public bug-reports, and they _expect_ to get attributed. I think any <br />worries about indefinite storage should be the other way around: we should <br />strive to make sure that the attributions are consistent and correct.<br /><br />If somebody really doesn't want their name and email known, they can say <br />that. We won't accept patches from them, but it's certainly no problem to <br />suppress "tested-by" etc things on request. Not that I have ever seen such <br />a request that I can remember, nor do I really expect to ever see one <br />(unless it's as a perverse reaction to this email where people just want <br />to be silly).<br /><br />Anyway, normal people talking about obscure and insane readings of some <br />random law is stupid. You should worry about "doing the right thing", not <br />about trying to read law as if it was some mindless machine that acted <br />like the computers you're used to.<br /><br />Let's face it, _everybody_ breaks laws if you think about them as some <br />inflexible and absolute rules. Probably every day.<br /><br />You roll through a STOP-sign (in California, it was almost as if that's <br />what the sign _meant_). Maybe you take a shortcut when crossing the street <br />and you don't walk _exactly_ on the zebra-crossing (or against a red light <br />just because there were obviously no cars within _miles_ of you). Maybe <br />you drive 58mph in a 55 zone. Maybe you walk around and spit out the <br />cherry-pits on the street rather than in a garbage can.<br /><br />Only insane people with OCD cannot understand that things aren't ever that <br />black-and-white. Use your good _judgement_ for chrissake!<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
