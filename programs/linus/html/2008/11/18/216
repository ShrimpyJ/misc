It could easily be something like a cache footprint issue. And while<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't know my sparc cpu's very well, I think the Ultrasparc-IIIi is<br />&gt; &gt; &gt; super- scalar but does no out-of-order and speculation, no?<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt; I does only very simple speculation, but you're description is accurate.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Surely it would do branch prediction, but maybe not indirect branch?<br /><br />That would be "branch target prediction" (and a BTB - "Branch Target <br />Buffer" to hold it), and no, I don't think Sparc does that. You can <br />certainly do it for in-order machines too, but I think it's fairly rare.<br /><br />It's sufficiently different from the regular "pick up the address from the <br />static instruction stream, and also yank the kill-chain on mispredicted <br />direction" to be real work to do. Unlike a compare or test instruction, <br />it's not at all likely that you can resolve the final address in just a <br />single pipeline stage, and without that, it's usually too late to yank the <br />kill-chain.<br /><br />(And perhaps equally importantly, indirect branches are relatively rare on <br />old-style Unix benchmarks - ie SpecInt/FP - or in databases. So it's not <br />something that Sparc would necessarily have spent the effort on.)<br /><br />There is obviously one very special indirect jump: "ret". That's the one <br />that is common, and that tends to have a special branch target buffer that <br />is a pure stack. And for that, there is usually a special branch target <br />register that needs to be set up 'x' cycles before the ret in order to <br />avoid the stall (then the predition is checking that register against the <br />branch target stack, which is somewhat akin to a regular conditional <br />branch comparison).<br /><br />So I strongly suspect that an indirect (non-ret) branch flushes the <br />pipeline on sparc. It is possible that there is a "prepare to jump" <br />instruction that prepares the indirect branch stack (kind of a "push <br />prediction information"). I suspect Java sees a lot more indirect <br />branches than traditional Unix loads, so maybe Sun did do that.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
