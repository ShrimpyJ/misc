Not that the reaction surprises me, seems like nobody<br />&gt; likes documentation (including me).<br /><br />It's that I don't like out-of-line documentation. It's a damn pain to <br />maintain, and it's _especially_ so when it's for small details rather than <br />"big picture" issues.<br /><br />I also consider this to be _exactly_ the same issue as translating kernel <br />messages into another language (which people have also wanted to do), <br />except the "other language" is a S390-specific "odd-speak" rather than a <br />real language.<br /><br />I have to say that I also dislike the technical implementation. I don't <br />like having yet another printk() wrapper - your "kmsg_warn()" won't play <br />well with people who have messages they want to print, but that use helper <br />routines - or then you'd need to essentially change _every_ printk to a <br />kmsg_xyz(). <br /><br />So if you want to have a hash (so that you can identify the _format_ <br />string rather than the printed out message), I personally think you'd be <br />better off thinking of it purely the same way as CONFIG_PRINTK_TIME, and <br />just have a config option that disables or enables the hashing of the <br />format string, the same way we have an option for disabling or enabling of <br />the timestamping of the printk.<br /><br />I also suspect that it would be better to not _print_ it, but only put it <br />into the dmesg logs (the same way we do with the urgency level marker).<br /><br />IOW, I think we could put a few lines of code in "vprintk" that just <br />hashes ove 'fmt' and then adds that to the output.<br /><br />And as for the actual explanations: either they need to be totally outside <br />the kernel (in a project of their own), or they'd need to be "kernel-doc" <br />style things that are _in_ the source code. Not in Documentation/. Not <br />separate from the printk() that they are associated with.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
