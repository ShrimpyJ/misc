So for anyone<br />&gt; traversing down that path, all you would be building would be the driver<br />&gt; itself, the whole rest of the kernel is "gone".<br /><br />Right. This was exactly what happened initially in the btrfs thing. And it <br />was horrid.<br /><br />It was horrid because it was totally unexpected for users, and causes huge <br />churn and confusion when trying to check out a totally different directory <br />layout (and git won't remove the old *.o files, so trust me, it _will_ be <br />confusing).<br /><br />But it was horrid also because if you do it the straightforward but stupid <br />way (the way that git definitely does support) by using a "subdirectory <br />merge" to merge the individual driver into a new location, it also makes <br />the history almost totally useless. Suddenly trivial things like<br /><br />	git log drivers/xyz/file.c<br /><br />don't work well at all any more, because in the old history it will all be <br />under the pathname "file.c" _without_ the drivers/xyz/ part. And the <br />merge diff will be just one huge mess.. <br /><br />So yes, git can do it that way, but the end result is so horrible as to be <br />worse than not importing the history at all!<br /><br />What I got Chris Mason to do was to run<br /><br />	git filter-branch --index odd-script-goes-here<br /><br />with that odd script looking something like:<br /><br />&gt;       #!/bin/sh<br />&gt;       exists=$(git ls-files fs/btrfs/)<br />&gt;       [ -z "$exists" ] &amp;&amp;<br />&gt;               git ls-files --stage |<br />&gt;               awk -F '\t' '{ print "0 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000\t" $2 "\n" $1 "\tfs/btrfs/" $2 }' |<br />&gt;               git update-index --index-info<br /><br />which basically does a directory rename in the branch (obviously, in this <br />case into fs/btrfs, which is not what _you_ want). That way, at least the <br />directory structure of the tree you merge has the same layout, and you <br />don't get _that_ particular directory jumping back and forth.<br /><br />Chris also merged in the history at the 2.6.26 tree (I think), so that <br />while his original history had had just a stand-alone btrfs build, the end <br />result was actually *totally* bisectable. Again, you should ask him about <br />any other scripts he ran.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
