I had done as well by my bisection. One of the reasons I didn't push <br />out my initial fix (just the plain revert) was exactly the fact that I <br />don't think that is sufficient. I want to _understand_ what was going on, <br />and get a feel from the commit message that makes me go "yeah, ok, makes <br />sense".<br /><br />&gt; Turns out it's the cpu_online_map difference.  If init_workqueues() is called<br />&gt; too early, only the boot cpu is set.  We then only create_workqueue_thread()<br />&gt; for the boot cpu.<br /><br />Indeed. I figured it out yesterday, since I didn't get an explanation soon <br />enough for my impatient self. So I ended up committing the fix as the <br />minimal patch I sent out earlier, with a fairly minimal explanation. I'll <br />happily take more fixes, but I think it should be ok.<br /><br />If S390 wants to do stop_machine() even before some of the basic <br />core_initcalls, I suspect it will have to change, but nothing I saw <br />indicated that it really needs to.<br /><br />&gt; If CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU=y, it's fine since the hotplug callback will create the<br />&gt; workqueue threads for the other cpus as they come up.  Without it, the kevent<br />&gt; workqueues on non-boot cpus don't get processed.<br /><br />.. and my default workstation config indeed hit this, since I normally <br />have a fairly minimal setup.<br /><br />&gt; &gt; Nor do I see a sign-off from Heiko on it.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I thought mine would be sufficient since we both work for IBM?<br /><br />Technically, yes, since you all sign your life away and do this for work, <br />but he normally signs off his patches, so the lack of sign-off didn't make <br />me go "hmm, this looks odd from a legal copyright standpoint", but rather <br />"hmm, maybe Heiko doesn't feel comfy with the patch since he didn't sign <br />off".<br /><br />To me, the legal side of the sign-off is actually secondary. The whole <br />thing was designed to be useful even in the absense of it. I've grown very <br />fond of seeing who has seen the patch (including who _should_ have seen it <br />but didn't react - the "cc" part ;)<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
