It has to be rebased to run as a postmerge tree, but it<br />&gt; does get tested by me (admittedly on my limited set of machines, which<br />&gt; don't include any actual devices that do block integrity) every time I<br />&gt; rebase.<br /><br />What I'm upset about is that this has apparently gotten not even some <br />trivial testing of the _default_ build. I'm not talking about any odd <br />config options here. I'm literally talking about the only _sane_ config <br />option case.<br /><br />You yourself admit that even you don't have any actual devices that can <br />support the block integrity stuff, yet you have apparently only compile- <br />tested the insane case of still enabling that thing and apparently nobody <br />else has bothered either.<br /><br />Was this in linux-next?<br /><br />Is linux-next coverage REALLY so weak that it doesn't even test the <br />default config options, much less any random options? What's the point of <br />linux-next then?<br /><br />Again, the date on that thing is claimed to be September 19th, although it <br />was obviously committed later.<br /><br />&gt; However, does this work for you?  It fixes the problem for me.<br /><br />I could trivially have fixed the compile issue. That's not what upsets me. <br />What upsets me is that this set of patches apparently had almost nobody <br />looking at them at all before they got sent to me.<br /><br />If it was some odd and unusual config option, I'd be less upset. hey, <br />stuff happens. But it sure as heck was nothing of the sort!<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
