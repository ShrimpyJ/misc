But you have the important part, which is<br />&gt; &gt; that Linus doesn't make the release until it is "ready".  2.6.13 was<br />&gt; &gt; released on August 28th, and 2.6.14 on October 27th ... so we<br />&gt; &gt; appear to have hit the goal this time through.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; However, three months is _far_ too long.  Look at what is happening<br />&gt; post-2.6.14?  There's loads of really huge changes going in which<br />&gt; were backed up over the last two months.<br /><br />Yes. Three months would be too much. I considered even 2.6.14 to be <br />delayed by at least one week. So 8 weeks is certainly better than it used <br />to be, but I think 6 weeks should be the goal-post.<br /><br />But to hit that, we'd might need to shrink the "merge window" from two <br />weeks to just one, otherwise there's not enough time to calm down. With <br />most of the real development happening during the previous calm-down <br />stage, that might not be impossible: we'd only have one week for merges, <br />but that isn't the week when development actually happens, so who cares?<br /><br />Everything said, I think 2.6.13-&gt;14 worked well enough, even if it's hard <br />to say how well a process works after one release. Considering that 2.6.13 <br />had the painful PCI changes (you may not have noticed too much, since they <br />were x86 only) and there were some potentially painful SCSI changes in the <br />.14 early merges, so it's not like 13-&gt;14 was an "easy" release - so the <br />process certainly _seems_ to be workable.<br /><br />So I'm planning on continuing with it unchanged for now. Two-week merge <br />window until -rc1, and then another -rc kernel roughly every week until <br />release. With the goal being 6 weeks, and 8 weeks being ok.<br /><br />I don't think anybody has been really unhappy with this approach?
