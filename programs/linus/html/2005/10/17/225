So close, yet so far. I'm _almost_ willing to just undo my "make <br />maxbatch huge" patch, and apply your patch, because now that I see how it <br />all happens to work together I'm convinced that it _almost_ works. Even if <br />it seems to be mostly by luck(*) rather than anything else.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />(*) Not strictly true. It may not be by design of the RCU code itself, but <br />it's definitely by design of the softirq's being designed to be robust and <br />have good latency behaviour. So it does work by design, but it works by <br />softirq design rather than RCU design ;)<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
