I think it does buy you reduced user confusion.<br /><br />The thing that worries me is that while the question may appear a bit more <br />straightforward that way, I actually think it makes the end result _less_ <br />so.<br /><br />Let's say that I'm a clueless user, and I just don't realize that SATA <br />depends on SCSI. After all, to a user, SATA sure as hell isn't SCSI, <br />that's just an implementation detail inside the kernel.<br /><br />So I've happened to say "m" to SCSI (for whatever reason - don't ask why <br />users do strange things, but maybe I realize that USB storage needs it), <br />and now I see the question for SATA. And I say "y".<br /><br />And then I wonder why I can only select my sata drivers as modules. I <br />didn't ask for SATA as a module, but they refuse to say "m".<br /><br />Now, with SCSI_SATA as a straight M/n choice (or whatever), if I had SCSI <br />as a module, at least I'll see at SATA selection time that I can only <br />compile SATA drivers as modules. I might wonder at that time why, but I <br />think it's less confusing there (and we could even mention it in the <br />help-text).<br /><br />I dunno. <br /><br />The _best_ choice as far as I can tell, is to just dis-associate SATA from <br />SCSI entirely. Even if it's an implementation choice, we could make it a <br />"select SCSI" instead of "depends on SCSI", so that from a _logical_ <br />standpoint the user could just select SATA support without even knowing <br />that the kernel happens to need the SCSI layer for it.<br /><br />I think that's what USB storage ended up doing, exactly because it <br />confused people too badly that they had to select SCSI in order to be able <br />to say "I want USB disk supprt".<br /><br />Of course, eventually I still hope that SATA could be done on the block <br />layer instead of even depending on SCSI at all, but hey, that's a totally <br />different issue.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
