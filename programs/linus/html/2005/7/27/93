Even without that, you can already do things like<br />&gt; &gt; <br />&gt; &gt;         git diff v2.6.10..v2.6.12<br />&gt; <br />&gt; That's a bit of a hack which really doesn't belong in the git tools.<br /><br />Actually, it's not a hack at all. It's very fundamentally how git works: <br />you give it two trees that it knows about, and it will show the <br />differences between them - regardless of whether they share any common <br />ancestry or not.<br /><br />&gt; It's not particularly hard to reparent the tree for real -- I'd much<br />&gt; rather see a tool added to git which can _actually_ change the<br />&gt; 1da177e4c3f41524e886b7f1b8a0c1fc7321cac2 commit to have a parent of<br />&gt; 0bcc493c633d78373d3fcf9efc29d6a710637519, and ripple the corresponding<br />&gt; SHA1 changes up to the current HEAD.<br /><br />I used to think I wanted to, but these days I really don't. One of the<br />reasons is that I expect to try to pretty up the old bkcvs conversion some<br />time: use the name translation from the old "shortlog" scripts etc, and<br />see if I can do some other improvements on the conversion (I think I'll<br />remove the BK files - "ChangeSet" etc).<br /><br />And it's really much easier and more general to have a "graft" facility.  <br />It's something that git can do trivially (literally a hook in<br />"parse_commit" to add a special parent), and it's actually a generic<br />mechanism exactly for issues like this ("project had old history in some<br />other format").<br /><br />Somebody already asked for having the import history for old historic <br />patches - which we _do_ actually have as patches, but which obviously <br />don't have any changelogs except for the version information. Most people <br />may not want that, but the thing is, with a "graft" facility, the people <br />who _do_ want that can easily see it all, and it is totally seamless.<br /><br />So it's not even a one-time hack - it's a real feature that just in the <br />kernel would have several cases we'd be able to use it for, and the same <br />is likely true for almost any other project that wasn't started purely <br />from git..<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
