There is _zero_ upside to doing it, I don't see why you <br />&gt; &gt; want to.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Being able to turn off your soundcard at runtime when you are not<br />&gt; using it was one of examples...<br /><br />I meant the "ACPI restores irq controller state" thing.<br /><br />Just leave it in. There's never any downside. If all the drivers end up <br />doing free_irq/request_irq(), restoring the irq controller state still <br />won't have any negative effect, and it solves the case where you have <br />drivers that don't do it.<br /><br />&gt; &gt; Just make ACPI restore the dang thing. It's the right thing to do.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Requires interpretter running with interrupts disabled =&gt; ugly :-(.<br /><br />I don't see that. What's ugly? I agree that ACPI is ugly, but I do _not_ <br />agree that it's ugly to restore irq controller state with interrupts <br />disabled. It MakesSense(tm) to do so.<br /><br />The fact that ACPI was designed by a group of monkeys high on LSD, and is <br />some of the worst designs in the industry obviously makes running it at <br />_any_ point pretty damn ugly. And the fact that MB vendors don't test it <br />with anything else than Windows (and sometimes you wonder whether they do <br />even that) doesn't help. So hell yes, it's ugly, and nasty. But interrupts <br />disabled has nothing to do with any of it.<br /><br />Besides, there's no real reason why you'd even have to do it with <br />interrupts disabled. I personally think that it makes _sense_ to try to <br />restore the irq controller state with irq's off, but as I made clear <br />earlier in this flame-fest, there's no real reason why you couldn't just <br />run with interrupts on.<br /><br />If an interrupt is screaming due to lack of initialization and gets turned<br />off, just make sure it gets re-enabled when it is being initialized.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
