Face the facts: we have <br />to do things incrementally. Any design that breaks unmodified drivers is <br />by _definition_ broken. You can't fix all drivers, and anybody who starts <br />their arguments with "we should just fix drivers" is living in la-la-land.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />My original PM suggestion handled that case perfectly well. The rule was <br />to make "go to sleep" be a two-phase operation:<br /><br /> - phase 1: save state, and possibly return errors<br /> - phase 2: turn off<br /><br />where the second stage was done with interrupts disabled and atomically.<br /><br />And the first phase was done without actually changing the state of the<br />device at all (so that if some device said "I can't do that, Dave", there<br />is no need to go back and wake anything up at all), and we could allocate <br />memory freely, because the disk was still working etc etc.<br /><br />For some totally inexplicable reason, the PM people never liked this, and <br />ended up doing a single "power off" setup. Which was always known to be <br />broken, and caused tons of problems, like the fact that save-to-disk had <br />to wake up a device that had already been shut off etc.<br /><br />So the fact that the PM layer was "simplified" to a single-phase setup <br />causes a lot of problems, but hey, stupid is as stupid does. I've given up <br />worrying about what crazy things the PM list comes up with, and instead I <br />now have a hard rule: a patch that breaks some machine gets reverted.<br /><br />Is that too hard to understand?<br /><br />I'll repeat it again:<br /><br />	A patch that breaks some machine gets reverted.<br /><br />and maybe somebody on the PM list will one day understand what it means to<br />have slow and steady progress instead of dicking around with the idea of <br />the week.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
