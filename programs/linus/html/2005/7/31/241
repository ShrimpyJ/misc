Because a driver that can't<br />handle that schenario is buggy for totally unrelated reasons, and doing a <br />"free_irq()/request_irq()" pair at suspend time is _not_ the solution!<br /><br />&gt; I'm trying to see which way they should be fixed, either the PM people<br />&gt; say we need request/free irq pairs or say we need to put support code in<br />&gt; the interrupt handlers,<br /><br />And I say that's not true. See (b) above. As far as I can tell, the <br />"interrupt when in D3" really looks _exactly_ the same as "interrupt when <br />device was just removed by the user", and nobody will hopefully argue that <br />free_irq/request_irq can protect against forced removal?<br /><br />&gt; This has nothing to do with the issues with highlevel PM interfaces<br />&gt; for shutting down hardware, this is do with fixing the drivers in the<br />&gt; kernel currently and what the correct way to do it is without breaking<br />&gt; someone elses hardware....<br /><br />... and I don't think this has _anything_ to do with free_irq/request_irq, <br />and everything to do with the fact that we can try to make at least the <br />common drivers "hardened" for unexpected interrupts coming in when the hw <br />might not be ready for them.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
