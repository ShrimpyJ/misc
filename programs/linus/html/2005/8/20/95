I don't tend to bother about slashdot, because quite frankly, the <br />whole _point_ of slashdot is to have this big public wanking session with <br />people getting together and making their own "insightful" comment on any <br />random topic, whether they know anything about it or not.<br /><br />[ And don't get me wrong - I follow slashdot too, exactly because it's fun <br />  to see people argue. I'm not complaining ;]<br /><br />And I don't tend to worry about the Inquirer and the Register, because <br />both of them are all about being rough and saying things in ways that <br />might not be acceptable in other places, and that's what makes them fun to <br />read. So when they then write something nasty about Linux (or me), hey, it <br />goes with the territory.<br /><br />But I was really hoping this particular wanking session wouldn't overflow <br />into Linux-kernel.<br /><br />Anyway, the posting Jesper points to is a fine one. Partly to show that<br />this trademark thing sure as hell isn't anything new, and partly because<br />the rules really haven't changed.<br /><br />So let's repeat that link again, just as background,<br /><br />	<a href="http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/2000week04/0654.html">http://boudicca.tux.org/hypermail/linux-kernel/2000week04/0654.html</a><br /><br />and then people should think a bit (and maybe research) what a trademark <br />really means.<br /><br />A trademark exists to set up some rules about using a "mark" (name, logo,<br />you name it) in trade. The people who pay to license (or get a unique<br />trademark of their own) a certain name do so because they care about that<br />particular name. People who don't care, don't pay. It's really that easy. <br />It's about getting legal protection for a particular name.<br /><br />For example, this means that a _user_ would never pay a single cent over a <br />trademark. I don't know why/how the Inq even came to that "companies to <br />pay for using free software" idea. It shows a total lack of understanding <br />about what a trademark is in the first place.<br /><br />Now, a company that has a company name usually _does_ want to protect<br />their name. Not always, but it's kind of embarrassing (and easily an<br />expensive and big bother) if somebody else trademarks that name, and then<br />sends a cease-and-desist order to you and forces you to switch to <br />something else.<br /><br />So you'll find that most commerical entities protect their name some way,<br />regardless of _what_ that name is. For example, let's say that you called <br />your company or distribution "Lipro", then you'd like to trademark that. <br />Goodie. It's pretty expensive, but most companies feel that it's more than <br />worth it to know that you've got exclusive rights to that name, and nobody <br />else can force you to change,<br /><br />So the first point here is that regardless of you call your Linux<br />distribution "Linux Something" or something totally different, you'll want<br />to protect that name if you are serious about making a big commercial<br />distribution. Exactly because you do _not_ want to be in the situation<br />that somebody else hijacks your name from you.<br /><br />Now, you can do that protection two different ways: you can make up a <br />unique name of your own ("Red Hat" or "Linspire" or "Debian" or whatever), <br />and trademark that. Then the trademark office keeps track of things, and <br />guarantees that there are no clashes (within your business area). <br /><br />Or, alternatively, you can ask somebody else who already has a unique name<br />if they might "sublicense" their name in combination with something else.  <br />In the case of "Linux", that name is already guaranteed unique by the<br />trademark office, so let's say that you felt that you wanted to have a<br />unique name that contained that, you'd approach LMI and say "I want to<br />call my magazine LinuxJournal, can you write up paperwork that makes sure<br />that nobody else can do so"?<br /><br />And let's repeat: somebody who doesn't want to _protect_ that name would <br />never do this. You can call anything "MyLinux", but the downside is that <br />you may have somebody else who _did_ protect himself come along and send <br />you a cease-and-desist letter. Or, if the name ends up showing up in a <br />trademark search that LMI needs to do every once in a while just to <br />protect the trademark (another legal requirement for trademarks), LMI <br />itself might have to send you a cease-and-desist-or-sublicense it letter. <br /><br />At which point you either rename it to something else, or you sublicense <br />it. See? It's all about whether _you_ need the protection or not, not <br />about whether LMI wants the money or not.<br /><br />As to the "cease-and-desist or sublicense the mark" letters, they are <br />sadly directly brought on by the requirements of maintaining a trademark. <br />If you have a trademark, you have to police it, which means that you have <br />to do trademark searches to see who uses it in a commercial setting, and <br />make sure that they use it properly.<br /><br />So to answer a particular question that came up here on Linux-kernel:  <br />"Does the linuxjournal.com pay $5000?".<br /><br />First off, I don't know where the $5000 came from - it's different for<br />different classes of people. Secondly, LinuxJournal was one of the<br />companies that raised the money to get the "Linux" trademark in the first<br />place! As a result, they don't pay a red cent, because they had been part<br />of protecting the name in the first place. And yes, they paid real lawyers<br />to do so. Their sublicense got "grandfathered in".<br /><br />Finally, just to make it clear: not only do I not get a cent of the<br />trademark money, but even LMI (who actually administers the mark) has so<br />far historically always lost money on it. That's not a way to sustain a<br />trademark, so they're trying to at least become self-sufficient, but so<br />far I can tell that lawyers fees to _give_ that protection that commercial<br />companies want have been higher than the license fees. Even pro bono <br />lawyers chanrge for the time of their costs and paralegals etc.<br /><br />Linux International has paid for it, maddog has worked on it on his own<br />time, and various companies have helped chip in (like the original<br />companies and people who got the trademark in the first place).<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
