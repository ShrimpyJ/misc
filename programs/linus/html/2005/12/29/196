Please don't. A <br />&gt; &gt; <br />&gt; &gt; 	From: Jes Sorensen &lt;jes&#64;sgi.com&gt; <br />&gt; <br />&gt; hm, i thought Jes having the first S-o-b line makes it well-defined that <br />&gt; he is the author? <br /><br />No. How many times do I have to say this? Just do a google for "sign-off", <br />"authorship" and "kernel", and the #1 hit (and a number of others in the <br />top ten) will be relevant.<br /><br />Sign-off has a _correlation_ with authorship, but it in no way implies it. <br />Not the first one, not the middle one, and not the last one.<br /><br />So the sign-off procedure has absolute no authorship meaning. It means one <br />thing and one thing only: it means that the person is convinced he has the <br />legal right to pass it on as a GPL'd piece of code. It means absolutely <br />_nothing_ else.<br /><br />[ Well, it has one _practical_ meaning: anybody who signs off or <br />  acknowledges a patch will be bothered by email if that patch turns out <br />  to be buggy, which is of course one of the biggest advantages of the <br />  whole thing.  In many ways the legalistic part of sign-offs are much <br />  less important from a development standpoint than that very _practical_ <br />  side to it ]<br /><br />Now, _if_ you are the author and your employer is ok with it being GPL'd, <br />the author and the first sign-off should match. But that's just one case <br />of sign-offs - it's the (a) case in the sign-off rules. But the (b) case <br />for sign-off's means that the person who does the sign-off may just be <br />signing off on somebody elses GPL'd work.<br /><br />So the (a) case is why there's obviously a _correlation_ with the author <br />and the first Signed-off-by: line. One common case is that they are the <br />same thing. But it really is not a 1:1 relationship.<br /><br />Any tool that believes that the first line of sign-off is special is a <br />BUGGY tool. And my email patch-application tools are not buggy. I hope <br />nobody else has such buggy tools either.<br /><br />The way to specify authorship is with a "From:" at the top of the message <br />(and, if no such line exists, it will be taken from the email headers). No <br />ifs, buts, maybes or guesses.<br /><br />This has been discussed before, but I'll continue to repeat it until I <br />don't need to:<br /><br />  Sign-offs go at the end, and stack up on top of each other (ie the list <br />  of sign-offs grows as the patch is sent on-ward - everybody adds their <br />  own sign-off last in the list).<br /><br />  Authorship goes at the top, and never changes, and only ever lists one <br />  single author (although we do end up having things like "modified by xyz <br />  for reason-or-other" in the commentary, so there can be those kinds of <br />  secondary authorship markers, of course).<br /><br />I realize that having multiple authors might sometimes be the right thing <br />to do, but git (nor any other SCM I know of) tracks only one author, so at <br />least for now we have to have that "primary author" approach with <br />secondary authors just mentioned in the text as such. And obviously, it's <br />always best if _all_ authors have a signed-off line.<br /><br />(That said, one-liners etc don't even need a sign-off. I'll sign off on <br />other peoples trivial patches if they didn't do it themselves: I'd _much_ <br />rather give them credit even without a sign-off, than to unnecessarily <br />re-do the trivial patch myself just to have the author and first sign-off <br />match)<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
