People had lots of <br />heads-up warning.<br /><br />&gt; Will it be a mistake to remove the obsolete raw driver?<br />&gt; Will it be a mistake to drop the Video4Linux API 1 ioctls?<br />&gt; Will it be a mistake to drop support for pcmcia-cs?<br /><br />And again, this is something that we've been warnign about. We have.<br /><br />I'm not talking about never obsoleting bad interfaces at all. I'm talking <br />about the unnecessary breakage that comes from changes that simply aren't <br />needed, and that isn't given proper heads-up for. <br /><br />We used to have a fairly clear point where we could break things, when we <br />had major kernel releases (ie 2.4 -&gt; 2.6 broke the module loader. It was <br />documented, and it was unavoidable). <br /><br />&gt; The fundamental problem is that the current development model <br />&gt; contains no well-defined points where breakages of the kernel-related <br />&gt; userspace were allowed and expected by users.<br /><br />The basic rule should be "never". For example, we now have three different <br />generations of the "stat()" system call, and yes, we wrote the code to <br />maintain all three interfaces. Breaking an old one for a new better one <br />simply wasn't an option.<br /><br />Now, the more specialized the usage is, the less strict the "never" <br />becomes. But if something becomes a pain for distribution managers (and <br />from Dave, it sounds like we've hit that way too often), that definitely <br />means that we've broken too many things.<br /><br />In short: I don't think anybody can complain about devfs-like things. <br />We've kept it up for a _long_ time, and there was tons of help for the <br />migration. But clearly DaveJ is unhappy, and that implies that we're not <br />doing as well as we should.<br /><br />(Which is not to say that we should necessarily bend over backwards to <br />make sure that DaveJ is _never_ unhappy. We should just try harder).<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
