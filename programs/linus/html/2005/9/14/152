The howtos are all out of date<br />&gt; and contradict each other.  They don't tell me what I need to know.<br />&gt; Everybody who uses them has their own collection of private scripts that<br />&gt; work around the worst misfeatures.  It's a complete fucking disaster.<br /><br />Actually, that's not true. I was asking people what scripts they use the <br />other day, and was surprised to learn that they don't use any at all.<br /><br />And especially if you use git itself - _without_ any special scripts, the<br />git mailing list is actually active and quite helpful. I haven't seen you <br />ask anything there.. Hint hint..<br /><br />&gt; The Debian cogito package doesn't have half the tools mentioned in the<br />&gt; howtos, as well as being months out of date.  Last time I had the energy<br />&gt; to fight with it, it didn't even support pack files.<br /><br />Now _that_ is true. You can't depend on vendor packaging. They are _way_ <br />too slow. For now, you absolutely have to do it yourself.<br /><br />(Well, "absolutely have to" may not be true - you can find RPM's etc, but <br />you might as well resign yourself to it for the next few months).<br /><br />Just do this: <br /><br /> - get the last daily snapshot from <br /><br />	<a href="http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/git-snapshots/git/">http://www.codemonkey.org.uk/projects/git-snapshots/git/</a><br /><br />   (this is mentioned in the overview, btw, directly reachable from <br />   www.kernel.org/git, so it's even well documented)<br /><br /> - compile and install it: "make" + "make install"<br /><br /> - just as an exercise (and because it's a lot smaller than the kernel <br />   and thus downloads much faster), get the git.git tree:<br /><br />	git clone rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git git-tree<br />	cd git-tree<br />	git checkout<br />	make<br />	make install<br /><br />   and you've now gotten the most up-to-date git there is. The nice thing <br />   about this is that going an update is now<br /><br />	git pull origin<br /><br />   so you can trivially keep track of it forever after.<br /><br /> - now you're getting ready to get a _real_ project. This will take some <br />   time.<br /><br />	git clone \<br />		rsync://rsync.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git \<br />		kernel-tree<br />	cd kernel-tree<br />	git checkout<br /><br />   and you have the kernel sources. On my 1.5Mbps DSL line, it takes about<br />   ten minutes, because you're downloading about 80MB of stuff (and <br />   the checkout unpacks 17,000 files and takes 5 seconds for me, but a <br />   _lot_ more if you don't have tons of memory to cache the thing).  But<br />   it's not horrible.<br /><br /> - play around.<br /><br />And git really isn't that hard to use any more. If you tried it two months <br />ago, it was a _lot_ more complicated. These days, if you can work with <br />CVS, it's a hell of a lot more pleasant than that ;)<br /><br />(It doesn't have a really nice graphical merge tool like BK did, for <br />example: you end up having to resolve merge clashes the CVS way by <br />searching for "&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;"/"======"/"&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;" markers.. The good news is that <br />it gets merge clashes pretty infrequently - I get them maybe once a week, <br />and I merge a _lot_)<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
