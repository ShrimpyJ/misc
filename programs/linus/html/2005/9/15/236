They aren't.<br /><br />If you think the data is wrong, then you are arguing against the COW. Yes, <br />the COW will make the data "wrong", but you can't escape that. That's what <br />a "write" by ptrace does.<br /><br />Btw, that's true even if we didn't do the COW - the COW just makes it even <br />more so. But even without the COW, the ptrace has written data that the <br />process didn't expect, and the process didn't write. <br /><br />Here's a big clue. A ptrace PTRACE_POKE-induced write WRITES DATA.<br /><br />Afterwards, the data is different from what if would have been if the<br />ptrace hadn't written. It's "wrong". Tough titties. It's what ptrace does.<br />Live with it. If you don't want wrong data, don't use ptrace to write <br />wrong data.<br /><br />However, you seem to confuse "write data" with "write data and make the<br />page writable".<br /><br />And as long as you continue to mix the two, there's no point in talking<br />about it. They are different.<br /><br />To recap: PTRACE_POKE _will_ write "wrong data" to the process. Part of it <br />directly (the actual data written), and part of it indirectly (the fact <br />that it has to break the COW connection in order to do the write). THAT IS <br />INESCAPABLE, AND IT IS A DIRECT RESULT OF PTRACE_POKE.<br /><br />And it has _nothing_ to do with whether we fault afterwards or not. <br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
