But I don't know the pressures which led<br />&gt; to its introduction in the first place.  CC'ed Roland who introduced<br />&gt; it in 2.6.4, and Linus who supported it in the recent discussions.<br /><br />It is clear that ptrace() _has_ to change semantics when it writes to a <br />shared page. That's fundamental. There's no way to avoid the COW, and yes, <br />that COW will have strange behaviour because it's semantically illegal (ie <br />the changed page will not be shared with anything else, including <br />necessarily subsequent fork()'ed children depending on if/how we change <br />that at some point).<br /><br />So the question is whether we do the _minimal_ semantic changes (just COW) <br />or whether we do even more semantic breakage.<br /><br />Roland's patch tries to keep the semantic breakage to a minimum. The COW<br />is forced upon us and there's no way we can avoid it, but the permission <br />change can be temporary and local to the ptrace, which is what we do now.<br /><br />I personally think that it's a pretty ugly thing, but all the real<br />ugliness is in the COW part - which we can't avoid. Rolands change is less<br />so. In fact, in many ways I think Roland's change is quite nice: you can<br />have a PROT_READONLY/PROT_NONE area that is visible from the debugger, but<br />continues to cause SIGSEGV's if the user process itself tries to access<br />it. To me, that's good.<br /><br />There would have to be some real advantage to _not_ doing what we're doing <br />now. And I don't see an advantage.<br /><br />The real complexity is not "maybe_mkwrite()", which is trivial. The real <br />complexity is the fact that we COW, but that's not something we can avoid, <br />and that's not something that has anything to do with maybe_mkwrite().<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
