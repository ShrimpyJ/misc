We have been using<br />Linux in its various flavors (distros) as our main operating system<br />for years as we wanted an alternative to Windows and macOS that could<br />handle the everyday internet-based tasks that one would expect to be<br />able to do on a modern computer.<br /><br />We understand that you have had second thoughts about your behavior<br />towards those who contribute to Linux development, especially when<br />critizing code that may not be up to scratch, and we do appreciate you<br />for considering the impact of your behavior. However, we are writing<br />you because we are concerned about several possible implications that<br />the recently introduced Code of Conduct could have on Linux and the<br />ecosystem as a whole.<br /><br />On the surface, the Code of Conduct that was adapted from the<br />Contributor Convenant appears laudable: an expectation of a hassle<br />free enviornment despite any individual contributors' physical and/or<br />social characteristics, examples of positive behaviors that would like<br />to be seen of contributors, and examples of negative behaviors that<br />need to avoided (and we do see that the examples given are often seen<br />in the behavior of those who harass others over the Internet).<br /><br />What we do have issue with is the origins of, the ideology behind, and<br />the behaviors exhibited by those who promulgate this code of conduct<br />as the solution to alleged social ills within the tech community. The ideas<br />expressed in the Contributor Convenant come from Social Justice, which<br />also on the surface appears laudable: the recognition and reparation<br />of past societal wrongs and activism towards ensuring equality for<br />historically oppressed groups. However, we have observed the actual<br />behavior of those who follow Social Justice, often referred to as<br />"Social Justice Warriors" or "SJWs," to be less than sincere.<br /><br />So-called Social Justice Warriors have been observed to show rather<br />hypocritical bullying behavior towards those they disagree with, both<br />online and in real life, while still claiming to be doing laudable<br />activism. Most of the harassing behavior by Social Justice Warriors we<br />have observed is often perpetrated towards those historically<br />considered to be oppressor groups (often not letting the target redeem<br />themselves or recognizing they have disposed of certain<br />"privileges"). But we have also seen that Social Justice Warriors will<br />harass those they claim to champion if they do not wholly and<br />uncritically agree with their beliefs and ideology.<br /><br />The wording of the Code of Conduct, as well as the Contributor<br />Covenant have been observed by posters on various websites as being<br />rather vague and open for abuse by those not above playing<br />victim. Rather more specifically, those so inclined could seemingly<br />choose to take offense at certain remarks or actions (regardless of<br />whether or not the person is actually offended), and then call for the<br />ousting of those they've (chosen to) see as harassers. It has been<br />feared that the Code of Conduct could be used to conduct an<br />ideological takeover of the Linux kernel (and, by extension, the free<br />software ecosystem) by finding dirt on various contributors and using<br />it to oust the rather brillant and technically-minded contributors,<br />thus causing the quality and cybersecurity of the Linux kernel to<br />decline while the community is consumed by political infighting and<br />fragmentation of the Linux ecosystem---perhaps eventually resulting in<br />Linux becoming a shell of its former self.<br /><br />The other reason we are writing you is because the authors of this<br />letter belong to the categories often championed by Social Justice<br />Warriors. One of us is gender non-conforming, while the other is<br />gay. We have watched in shock over the past few years as so-called<br />Social Justice Warriors have become the de-facto representatives of<br />our kinds, often silencing, shaming, and harassing those who are of<br />these characteristics for not agreeing with the now-mainstream Social<br />Justice ideology, all while claiming to be "the good ones" fighting<br />oppression. At least one of us chooses to stay in the closet, not<br />because of the stereotypical conservative, the Christian<br />fire-and-brimstone preacher, or the orthodox Muslim cleric; we have<br />grown afraid of those who claim to be our own kinds.<br /><br />While your decision to reconsider some aspects of your communication<br />style is commendable, we implore you to reconsider the Code of<br />Conduct. Perhaps the document could be modified to address its<br />shortcomings and prevent its abuse, or the document could be rescinded<br />and a more suitable document could be drafted. We do not want to see<br />this wonderful technical achievement, one we utilize everyday for our<br />personal computing needs, become compromised by those with insincere<br />ideological intent.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />curious and Adele Radul<br /><br />P.S.
