And while the  key has a lot of signatures, none of them are<br />&gt; &gt; any that I have recognized previously from kernel development.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; I agree on this point, and will have a different key with at least some<br />&gt; kernel developers signatures for 4.20<br /><br />I don't reall yneed to absolutely have some signature chain for the<br />keys - but I do want to know that it's not some maintainership fight<br />brewing, and I'd *really* like to see explicit acknowledgement from<br />people about this all.<br /><br />The pgp signature is useful even without the chain of other people<br />signing it, since it's still going to mean (going forward) that the<br />same person who controls the key is sending me pull requests. So it's<br />worth it even without the absolute chain.<br /><br />But the first time I pull is special. For me, the MAINTAINERS file<br />currently still says<br /><br />  [torvalds&#64;i7 linux]$ ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl fs/9p/<br />  Eric Van Hensbergen &lt;ericvh&#64;gmail.com&gt; (maintainer:9P FILE SYSTEM)<br />  Ron Minnich &lt;rminnich&#64;sandia.gov&gt; (maintainer:9P FILE SYSTEM)<br />  Latchesar Ionkov &lt;lucho&#64;ionkov.net&gt; (maintainer:9P FILE SYSTEM)<br />  v9fs-developer&#64;lists.sourceforge.net (open list:9P FILE SYSTEM)<br />  linux-kernel&#64;vger.kernel.org (open list)<br /><br />and I realize that in practice it's been not very maintained and most<br />of the patches have just been going through Andrew (actually, _most_<br />patches haven't really been about 9p at all, but have been about<br />updating 9p for non-9p work).<br /><br />So I would basically want to see Andrew and/or others be on record of<br />saying "yup, this looks good, go ahead and pull from Dominique".<br /><br />Then, next time you send me a pull request, it will be "all systems<br />normal", and I won't care about who has signed your key, I'll care a<br />lot more about "it's the same key as the last time, or at least the<br />new key is signed by the old key I already recognize for 9p".<br /><br />That's the main issue for me.<br /><br />           Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
