And I don't really _mind_ that last step<br />either, but since we don't know exactly what it was that it broke, and<br />we're past rc7, I don't think we really have any option but the revert<br />it.<br /><br />And if we revert it, I think we need to just remove the<br />VM_BUG_ON_VMA() that it was supposed to fix. Because I do think that<br />it is quite likely that the real bug is that overzealous BUG_ON(),<br />since I can't see any reason why anonymous mappings should be special<br />there.<br /><br />But I'm certainly also ok with re-visiting that commit later.  I just<br />think that right _now_ the above is my preferred plan.<br /><br />Kirill?<br /><br />&gt; I'm all for deleting that VM_BUG_ON_VMA() in zap_pmd_range(), it was<br />&gt; just a compromise with those who wanted to keep something there;<br />&gt; I don't think we even need a WARN_ON_ONCE() now.<br /><br />So to me it looks like a historical check that simply doesn't<br />"normally" trigger, but there's no reason I can see why we should care<br />about the case it tests against.<br /><br />&gt; (It remains quite interesting how exit_mmap() does not come that way,<br />&gt; and most syscalls split the vma beforehand in vma_adjust(): it's mostly<br />&gt; about madvise(,,MADV_DONTNEED), perhaps others now, which zap ptes<br />&gt; without prior splitting.)<br /><br />Well, in this case it's the ftruncate() path, which fundamentally<br />doesn't split the vma at all (prior *or* later). But yes, madvise() is<br />in the same boat - it doesn't change the vma at all, it just changes<br />the contents of the vma.<br /><br />And exit_mmap() is special because it just tears down everything.<br /><br />So we do have three very distinct cases:<br /><br /> (a) changing and thus splitting the vma itself (mprotect, munmap/mmap, mlock),<br /><br /> (b) not changing the vma, but changing the underlying mapping<br />(truncate and madvise(MADV_DONTNEED)<br /><br /> (c) tearing down everything, and no locking needed because it's the<br />last user (exit_mmap).<br /><br />that are different for what I think are good reasons.<br /><br />                   Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
