Rspamd, by default, includes the sender<br />&gt; address into the list of signed headers:<br /><br />Ugh. That's just broken.<br /><br />&gt; There is RFC6377 which discusses this problem. On possible solution is<br />&gt; a mailing list service which understands DKIM and can check/sign the<br />&gt; messages.<br /><br />I think that is almost purely historical.<br /><br />People figured it out. The actual solution was that mailing lists just<br />don't rewrite headers or bodies, but they do set that "sender" line<br />(and add various new ones, like "List-ID" etc unsubscribe<br />information).<br /><br />And that was exactly so that dkim would just work, without the list<br />having to then add its own signing that just causes even more<br />problems.<br /><br />[ And no, lkml isn't actually great at this - it will mess up<br />whitespace on headers, so it only works with a relaxed/relaxed dkim<br />signature.<br /><br />  But honestly, if you use strict/strict, you're doing something<br />wrong. It's a bad idea. Smtp was never whitespace-strict ]<br /><br />&gt; This is actually according to RFC. Listing signed header-fields<br />&gt; multiple times prohibits them from beeing modified and resigned my other<br />&gt; MTAs.<br /><br />Again, that is mostly historical baggage. I don't think anybody<br />actually does that.<br /><br />So yes, you'll find a lot of "what ifs" from ten years ago when people<br />weren't actually using dkim and mailing lists didn't try to work with<br />it. Mostly theoretical "this is how it could work".<br /><br />I've seen some truly horrendous suggestions for mailing lists, like<br />always rewriting "From" headers etc exactly so that you can then make<br />a new dkim signature. That would make for a really bad mailing list.<br /><br />.. and yes, I'm sure such bad mailing lists exist.<br /><br />                Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
