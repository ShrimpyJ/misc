Who knows?).<br /><br />So while maybe just continuing to do this means that it becomes second<br />nature, I'm starting to think that mailing list automation really<br />would be a good idea:<br /><br />On Tue, Oct 23, 2018 at 1:04 PM Konstantin Ryabitsev<br />&lt;konstantin&#64;linuxfoundation.org&gt; wrote:<br />&gt;<br />&gt; On Tue, Oct 23, 2018 at 10:46:06AM +0100, Linus Torvalds wrote:<br />&gt; &gt;If it's a "proper" pull request (ie done by git request-pull), then<br />&gt; &gt;the magic marker would be that it as that<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;    for you to fetch changes up to %H:<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;line where %H is the hash of the tip of the tree that is requested to be pulled.<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt;Then automation could literally just check "is that commit in Linus'<br />&gt; &gt;public tree", and when that happens, generate an automatic<br />&gt; &gt;notification that the pull request in question has been merged.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; I can probably do something like that at kernel.org. How about something<br />&gt; more generic -- e.g. a simple tool that asks a remote web service to<br />&gt; notify you when a commit-id is seen in one of the kernel.org repos?<br /><br />So I think it might be good to have some generic model for "give me a<br />trigger when XYZ hits git tree ABC" that people could just do in<br />general, *but* I think the "scan mailing lists for regular pull<br />requests" would actually be nicer.<br /><br />Maybe it would be just a special-case wrapper around a more generic<br />thing, but this:<br /><br />&gt; - send a REST request to <a href="https://foo.kerkel.org/lmk">https://foo.kerkel.org/lmk</a>:<br />&gt;<br />&gt;   {<br />&gt;     "tree": "mainline",<br />&gt;     "commit": "123abc...abc555",<br />&gt;     "notify": "(output of $(git config user.email)"<br />&gt;   }<br /><br />doesn't really sound all that nice for the "I sent a git pull request,<br />and want to be notified".<br /><br />It would be much nicer if the "notification" really did the right<br />thing, and created an actual email follow-up, with the correct To/Cc<br />and subject lines, but also the proper "References" line so that it<br />actually gets threaded properly too.<br /><br />That implies that it really should be integrated into the mailing list itself.<br /><br />But I don't know how flexible the whole lkml archive bot is for things<br />like this. But I assume you have _some_ hook into new messages coming<br />in for lore.kernel.org?<br /><br />&gt; Would that be a useful alternative? If yes, what would be your preferred<br />&gt; workflow for such tool instead of "git lmk [commit] [tree-moniker]"?<br /><br />I really do suspect that "I sent out a pull request, I'd like to be<br />automatically notified when it gets upstream" would be the primary<br />thing.<br /><br />And by "upstreamed" it isn't necessarily just my tree, of course.<br /><br />Are there other situations where you might want to track something<br />_outside_ of a pull request? Maybe. I can't really think of a lot of<br />them, though. Patches etc don't have commit ID's to track, but it<br />*might* be interesting to see similar automation just based on the git<br />patch-ID. But that sounds more like a patchwork issue than something<br />like "track pull requests".<br /><br />But this might be one of those "maybe a quick prototype gives people<br />ideas". Sometimes people _really_ hate automation, but it sounds to me<br />like it would be a lovely thing to have.<br /><br />                    Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
