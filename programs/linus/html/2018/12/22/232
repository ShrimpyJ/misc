I even tried to fix all of<br />&gt; userspace after this got NACKED<br /><br />Seriously, the "we don't break user space" is the #1 rule in the<br />kernel, and people should _know_ it's the #1 rule.<br /><br />If somebody ignores that rule, it needs to be escalated to me.<br />Immediately. Because I need to know.<br /><br />I need to know so that I can override the bogus NAK, and so that we<br />can fix the breakage ASAP. The absolute last thing we need is some<br />other user space then starting to rely on the new behavior, which just<br />compounds the problem and makes it a *much* bigger problem.<br /><br />But I also need to know so that I can then make sure I know not to<br />trust the person who broke rule #1.<br /><br />This is not some odd corner case for the kernel. This is literally the<br />rule we have lived with for *decades*.<br /><br />So please escalate to me whenever you feel a kernel developer doesn't<br />follow the first rule. Because the code that broke things *will* be<br />reverted (*).<br /><br />                    Linus<br /><br />(*) Yes, there are exceptions. We have had situations where some<br />interface was simply just a huge security issue or had some other<br />fundamental issue. And we've had cases where the breakage was just so<br />old that it was no longer fixable. So even rule #1 can sometimes have<br />things that hold it back. But it is *very* rare. Certainly nothing<br />like this.<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
