Eric, your behavior is<br />entirely out of line, and now we apparently have a regression that<br />goes back to June that I was not told about because of your incorrect<br />stance.<br /><br />Eric, I want to make this 1000% clear: there are no user space bugs.<br />If it used to work, then user space was clearly doing the right thing.<br />The fact that you tried to several times claim it was buggy user space<br />is a serious breach of trust. You KNOW this is the case.<br /><br />Seriously.
