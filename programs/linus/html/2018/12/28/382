Not at<br />all. It's just that it's really more of an archival model than a<br />"people read it" - so you send your emails to a group of people, and<br />then you cc lkml so that when that group gets expanded people can be<br />pointed at the whole thread. Or, obviously, so that commit messages<br />etc can point to discussion.<br /><br />But that does mean that any lkml cc shouldn't be expected to cause a<br />reaction in itself. It's about other things.<br /><br />&gt; syzbot not doing bisection is not the root cause of this<br /><br />Root case? No. But if you do bisection, it means that you can now<br />target things much better. So then it's not lkml and "random<br />collection of maintainers", but a much more targeted group.<br /><br />And that targeted group also ends up being a lot more receptive to it.<br /><br />Again, look at the raw syzbot email and the email by Wanpeng Li. Yes,<br />the syzbot email did bring in a reasonable set of people just based on<br />the oops (I think it did "get_mainainter" on kvm_ioapic_scan_entry()).<br />But Wangpeng ended up sending it to the *particular* people who were<br />directly responsible.<br /><br />&gt; 2. syzbot reports are not worse then average human reports, frequently better.<br /><br />No, they really aren't.<br /><br />They are better in a *technical* sense, but they are also very much<br />obviously automated, which makes the target people take them much less<br />seriously.<br /><br />When you see lots of syzbot emails, and there are lots of more or less<br />random recipients that may or may not be correct, what's the natural<br />reaction to that?<br /><br />Look up "bystander effect".<br /><br />&gt; 3. Bisection is useful, but not important in most cases.<br /><br />No.<br /><br />Exactly because of the problem syzbot has. It's too scatter-shot.<br />People clearly ignore it, because people feel it's not _their_ issue.<br /><br />The advantage of bisection is that it makes the problem much more<br />specific. Right now, you'll find that many developers ignore syzbot<br />simply because it's not worth their time to chase down whether it's<br />even their problem.<br /><br />See what I'm saying?<br /><br />It's the whole "data vs information" issue. Particularly when cc'ing<br />maintainers, who get hundreds of emails a day, you need to convince<br />them that this email is _relevant_.<br /><br />                  Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
