Yes. But no, it didn't make SENSE. <br /><br />It did not make sense on _any_ system design level. And that's what I make<br />my judgement calls on. <br /><br />The problem is that I consider any driver that tries to "know" the<br />bootsequence to be a very very broken driver. We had that problem several<br />years ago, where a driver that was a module had a very different boot<br />sequence than a driver that was compiled in. It results in complete and<br />utter confusion, because a driver ends up working/notworking according to<br />whether it was installed as a module or not.<br /><br />I fixed that, and people complained because I broke a lot of drivers. <br />Tough luck, they got fixed, and we're the better for it, because the old<br />code did not make sense - different memory management depending on whether<br />they were compiled in or drivers. <br /><br />Using "initmem_freed" does not make sense, in the very same very real<br />manner. A driver should know effing all about the boot sequence, and<br />should not care. If it does, it is broken, because it then gets broken<br />when I change the boot sequence. Comprende? <br /><br />So what happened was that I cleaned up the boot sequence, and no<br />well-written drivers broke. That should give you some food for thought. I<br />didn't need to touch any of the drivers I use.<br /><br />I'd like to re-iterate: I _maintain_ the kernel. And because I do that, it<br />makes _no_ sense to me to have drivers (or anything else, for that matter)<br />that "know" about internal mm details.<br /><br />Case dismissed, "initmem_freed" is never going back in, exactly because<br />the _only_ reason for having it is to support bad code that has spagetti-<br />like knowledge of some arcane thing that it shouldn't know about.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/faq.html">http://www.tux.org/lkml/faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
