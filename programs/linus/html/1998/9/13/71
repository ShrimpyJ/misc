So the tulip driver must have some very subtle problem that<br />only makes it break on some systems or with certain timings that are hard<br />to see normally. <br /><br />That said, we switched whole-sale from tulip-based cards to Intel<br />EtherExpress Pro100's due to the tulips just not being consistent enough. <br />They sometimes got really good behaviour, but sometimes they just were<br />extremely slow and noisy on the cable. Whether that was a hardware problem<br />or simply due to the driver we couldn't tell (but both the tulip.c and the<br />de4x5 driver had the same behaviour - we suspect hardware).<br /><br />The EEpro100 cards have been much more consistent: we got higher peak<br />bandwidth from the tulip cards, but average bandwidth and network<br />behaviour is much better with the EEpro100. <br /><br />&gt; On my System with a<br />&gt; Lite On Network card (OEM)  with a  LC82C168 Chip<br />&gt; (though driver says: Digital DS21143 Tulip at 0xb400, 00 48 54 00 97 f8, IRQ 9.  )<br />&gt; the tulip driver worked very well.<br /><br />You could try to use the de4x5 driver too, just to see whether that maybe<br />works for you. I've had conflicting reports on the different drivers: on<br />some cards the de4x5 driver works better, on others the tulip driver seems<br />to work better.<br /><br />I suspect it's either a hardware or software timing problem (shared by<br />both drivers if software), and that one or the other driver just happens<br />to work better entirely due to random timing issues. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/faq.html">http://www.tux.org/lkml/faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
