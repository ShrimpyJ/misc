On the<br />&gt; motherboard that works reliably, the three NCR devices are XT-PIC and not<br />&gt; symmetric.<br /><br />I'm really surprised about why so many BIOSes will mark interrupts<br />edge-triggered. I don't know why they do it, as it's almost always safe<br />_not_ to do it (the only device that it's not safe for that I know of is<br />the timer - I'm sure there are others, but they must be rather rare). <br /><br />Does anybody on the kernel list know how the BIOS makes its decisions<br />about how to mark interrupts edge vs level-triggered? It would be<br />informative to know, because maybe we should override it (but without<br />knowing what the BIOS does I feel very nervous indeed about overriding<br />it). <br /><br />&gt; This is probably dumb but how is the choice made between edge triggered<br />&gt; and level triggered interrupts?  I don't recall seeing a bios setting.<br /><br />The BIOS essentially tells us which to use by virtue of the MP table.<br />There's a feature there saying what kind of interrupt we should use. For<br />example, for ISA devices we should use edge-triggered not because that's<br />the right thing to do, but because that's the historcially correct thing<br />to do - and we have no way of knowing whether the device requires us to do<br />it or not.<br /><br />To some degree edge-triggering is "safer", because at least you don't end<br />up taking endless interrupts. At the same time it's certainly not safer as<br />a reliability issue, because you can much more easily have lost<br />interrupts.<br /><br />See the function "irq_trigger()" in arch/i386/kernel/io_apic.c, or more<br />exactly the "MPBIOS_trigger()" thing that parses the BIOS MP table to<br />determine whether to use edge (0) or level (1) triggered interrupts. <br /><br />&gt; is it a kernel flag that I can pass to the APIC code? I started having<br />&gt; this problem after I put in an SIIG ISA card consisting of a prom that<br />&gt; would supposedly allow me to use an LS-120 - it made all kinds of goofy<br />&gt; changes to the system bios settings and even though I cleared CMOS, the<br />&gt; mother board has not been working in SMP mode with any heavy IO.<br /><br />You could try to make irq_trigger() always return 1 for PCI devices,<br />regardless of what the MP table says.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/faq.html">http://www.tux.org/lkml/faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
