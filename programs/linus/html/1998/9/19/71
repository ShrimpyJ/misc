Both of<br />them are completely broken, for several reasons:<br /> - they use up a long-word for _one_ bit of information. That's 63 wasted<br />   bits on some architectures.<br /> - they are incorrectly used by drivers as-is, it's better to just remove<br />   them.<br /><br />If you think we need a lock, it had better be something like "dev-&gt;flags",<br />or even better just a well-defined "dev-&gt;spinlock". Right now it's very<br />obvious that nobody knows the proper meaning of either tbusy or interrupt.<br /><br />&gt; In any case driver should have some lock visible from outside.<br /><br />Why? I've heard this twice, and I don't see it. The upper layers need to<br />guarantee that the driver transmit routine is entered in a single-threaded<br />manner, and they already do that. The driver can then internally do<br />whatever further locking it needs, and return whatever status it wants to. <br /><br />Right now, as far as I can see, both "interrupt" and "tbusy" are<br />completely unused for _anything_ sane. "interrupt" is not used at all by<br />the networking layer, and "tbusy" is mis-used by certain parts of the<br />networking layer and then used as a silly and incorrect lock by networking<br />drivers. <br /><br />I think I'll just remove them completely, and then somebody can try to add<br />them back when they have some meaning. Right now they are very obviously<br />only confusing people, with network driver people having a completely<br />different idea of their use than certain network people (ank and davem),<br />and other network people equally obviously just not knowing what they are<br />there for in the first place. <br /><br />&gt; If you remember, I proposed to make one sample driver with<br />&gt; really correct interface to upper and lower layers<br />&gt; and to maintain it permanently, keeping it in sync both<br />&gt; with networking core and with irq/smp, and, maybe, ignoring news<br />&gt; on hardware market. This driver would serve as sample for driver writers.<br /><br />One driver doesn't much help, especially not this late in the game. I want<br />a 2.2 out the door.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
