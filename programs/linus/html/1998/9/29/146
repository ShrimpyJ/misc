It makes my just<br />hate you guys even more. Don't go that way, you'll just find me even<br />harder to work with. <br /><br />&gt; Ok, so I ask again (and why the hell are you up this early also?), what is <br />&gt; Linus' reason for not applying the patches?<br /><br />Linu's reason for not applying the patches is that I get this frigging big<br />patch with no explanations of what it does.<br /><br />I applied the generic non-driver-specific parts, and people promised me it<br />wouldn't hurt. It hurt, because it turns out that the patch contained<br />parts that _were_ driver-specific after all. Should that make me happy? <br />No, it just makes me even more stronly feel that I want the vger patch<br />explained. <br /><br />David has gone through this. He _should_ know how this is handled, but<br />apparently he has forgotten. He split up his vger backlog into reasonable<br />patches, and added a explanation to the top of them. And he found out that<br />I do apply the patches when it's done that way.<br /><br />If patches come to me without explanation, I apply them only if I can look<br />at the patch and say "ok, that's right, obviously I should apply this". <br />But for larger patches I _require_ that the person who sends me the patch<br />do more than say "ok, this is the sync-up with vger". <br /><br />The fact that this is painful to do for patch maintainers is irrelevant. <br />Because quite frankly, I'd rather spread the pain than take it all onto<br />myself. And if they had done the patches on a more timely basis instead of<br />buffering them all up, it would be less of a pain. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
