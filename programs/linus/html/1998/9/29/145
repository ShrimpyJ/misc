The whole patch has no effect<br />&gt; on non-experimental i386 configuration, but it's essential to get almost all<br />&gt; other architectures work -- I really don't want to have the same situation<br />&gt; in 2.2 as we did in 2.0 where only i386 and Alpha were compilable from your<br />&gt; tree and all other architectures needed lots of patches. Please tell me what<br />&gt; should I do.<br /><br />I'll accept patches still, but I want them explained better than they have<br />been so far. So far I have one huge patch that I can look at and say "ok,<br />this won't impact me", and as such it's in theory safe to apply. However,<br />at the same time I _know_ it will impact me in the future by me just being<br />in line to get the complaints.<br /><br />What happened was that a _long_ time ago I decided to finally cut over to<br />the new FB-console stuff, because the m68k people swore up and down that<br />it was stable and good, and it had obviously been getting a lot of testing<br />on other non-x86 architectures. So I thought it was a no-brainer. <br /><br />Instead of being a no-brainer, it turned out to be quite fundamentally<br />buggy, and I'm very grateful to Martin that he has been fixing the bugs. <br />But at the same time I'm _really_ disappointed by how the thing has been<br />handled, and very very disappointed by vger.<br /><br />The reason I'm disappointed is that vger in particular has been acting as<br />a "buffer" between me and bug-fixes, so that now we're in the situation<br />that there are obviously bugs, and there are obviously bug-fixes, but I<br />don't see it as such, I only see this humongous patch.<br /><br />I don't know what it fixes, because vger has kept me out of the loop, and<br />quite frankly I don't have the time to look at several hundred kilobytes<br />of compressed patches by hand. And I refuse to apply patches that I don't<br />feel comfortable with. <br /><br />As a result, I want people to _tell_ me what the patch fixes. And that<br />probably means by now that I need to get each driver update on its own,<br />with explanations. <br /><br />This is _exactly_ the same thing that made me hate vger when it came to<br />networking patches. And I'm going to ask David once again to just shut<br />vger down, because these problems keep on happening.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
