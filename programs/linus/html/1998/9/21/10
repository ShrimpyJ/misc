We might still want to throttle the rate to make<br />&gt; <br />&gt; You would block interrupt handling for all devices that are sharing the<br />&gt; IRQ with your broken code.<br /><br />True. So it probably isn't that good a thing to do even in that kind of<br />"perfect world".<br /><br />Maybe we should re-define "perfect world" as "each device has exactly one<br />interrupt, and it is never shared, and we can have nice single-threading<br />guarantees with no other interrupts locked out while we execute one<br />interrupt". <br /><br />However we define that "perfect world" it is very clear that we're not<br />living in it, and aren't likely to see it in the near future. And that's<br />why network handling is better done in the bottom half handlers. Even if<br />that means a lower maximum packet throughput.<br /><br />&gt; &gt; And btw, for people worrying about SA_INTERRUPT - I'll probably just make<br />&gt; &gt; it go away. It doesn't have any real redeeming features. <br />&gt; <br />&gt; Why?<br />&gt; <br />&gt; SA_INTERRUPT + SHIRQ made problems sharing IRQs between the SCSI<br />&gt; sub-system and the network sub-system for years. This does not mean that<br />&gt; SA_INTERRUPT is essentially bad.<br /><br />See the previous mail about why SA_INTERRUPT no longer makes any sense<br />(and why it _used_ to make sense - I want people to understand why it was<br />done in the first place and that it had a valid reason that just no longer<br />makes much of a difference). <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
