Anybody who is not willing to take that much care of his patches<br />&gt; &gt; that he can't maintain it while I haven't accepted it, I don't want to<br />&gt; &gt; accept patches from anyway. <br />&gt; <br />&gt; Linus, the problem is that when I submit a patch, I don't want to<br />&gt; unneccesarily overload you by resubmitting on too short a notice. <br /><br />If this is the problem, we can easily rectify that by just setting up a<br />few reasonably simple guidelines. I'm really not hard to work with, it's<br />just that I get overloaded, and when I have more important things (be they<br />Linux-related or not), I start dropping. <br /><br />Think of me as a slow network card that drops packets when overloaded, and<br />use a TCP-like congestion avoidance technique ;) <br /><br />The guidelines are fairly simple:<br /><br /> - I don't mind re-sent patches. At worst, I can just drop it again, and<br />   on the whole that's simply not a problem. I obviously don't want to be<br />   patch-flooded, and for practical reasons it's just silly to re-send the<br />   same patch two days in a row, but sending a patch a week later is not a<br />   problem for me, even if the first one is still on my mind. <br /><br /> - At the same time, I don't think other developers should need to worry<br />   overmuch. If you have a patch that you think should go in, but is not<br />   something you have hanging over your head all the time, I don't mind it<br />   in the least if you decide that it can wait more than a week. So you<br />   should _not_ have the feeling that you have to check my patches every<br />   week to see whether it made it in this time. <br /><br /> - It's ok even to resend a patch that I already applied, as long as it's<br />   _exactly_ the same patch as you sent last time. I keep track of what I<br />   apply, believe it or not, and it's fairly low-overhead for me to go<br />   "Oh, I've seen this patch before, drop it". It's only if your new patch<br />   conflicts with an older one that there can be problems (I might decide<br />   to drop it exactly because I had already seen it before, and then the<br />   changes would be lost)<br /><br />Essentially, think of it as a communications problem, where the physical<br />link is reliable, but where you have a many-to-one communication and as a<br />result the receiver gets overloaded. You want your message to come<br />through, and you get ACK's but not NACK's. And the latency is on the order<br />of a few days, but can easily be shorter. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
