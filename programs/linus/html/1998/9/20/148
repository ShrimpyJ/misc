Laferriere wrote:<br />&gt; &gt; <br />&gt; &gt; Note that "dropping" was meant to be more generic than just dropping a<br />&gt; &gt; packet. We can decide to drop packets proactively by just deciding to<br />&gt; &gt; disable the interface completely for a while, to make sure it doesn't<br />&gt; &gt; flood us with interrupts. That's obviously fairly extreme, but it might be<br />&gt; &gt; the simplest answer (the driver could even decide on its own to disable<br />&gt;<br />&gt; 	I sure hope this would be a -last- ditch effort to prevent<br />&gt; 	interupt flooding .  In my router I sure wouldn't want this <br />&gt; 	to be a -os- made decision I'd definatly would want me to be<br />&gt; 	able to turn it off or on as I see needed .<br /><br />Obviously, yes. It's more a matter of "we know we can't keep up anyway, so<br />let's drop pro-actively and get some real work done instead of just<br />dropping after the fact and not having any CPU time left for anything<br />else". <br /><br />And before dropping, we should just try to tell the source to not send as<br />fast. I didn't even know that there was a protocol for doing that on an<br />ethernet level. Becker is right that that's the obvious first thing to do. <br /><br />And finally, again, it should hopefully be equally obvious that the<br />_first_ objective should always be to be fast enough to not have to drop<br />in the first place. Dropping is bad. It's just that dropping and being<br />dead about it is even worse ;)<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
