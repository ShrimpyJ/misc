And get me off the Cc list.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Linus you could start with the simple "My Xserver has hung in a tight loop<br />&gt; with signals blocked", now I wont have to reboot case.  I've seen X do exactly<br />&gt; that before now. Normally trying to clean up from an out of memory or a sigsegv<br /><br />Why is your X server in a tight loop with signals blocked?<br /><br />For example, it _never_ makes any sense to block SIGSEGV.  For all I know,<br />XFree86 may do it, but the whole point is that it is _wrong_ to try to fix<br />those kinds of bugs in the kernel, when what you guys should _really_ be<br />doing is to talk to the XFree86 guys and tell them they have a problem. <br /><br />&gt; Your daemon hanging around for a kill case doesnt work because there is<br />&gt; a fundamental race between telling the card and the daemon about a state<br />&gt; change in the video programming.<br /><br />Umm?? There is no race, because the _only_ thing that changes the video<br />mode is the deamon. NOTHING else. So when the deamon decides to change<br />modes, it can do so - and doesn't ask anything for permission.<br /><br />Anyway, my main gripe is not about making kernel changes - if somebody has<br />a valid concern about these things, I'm more than happy to accomodate<br />them. My gripe is that people think that it has to be solved in the kernel<br />_first_, without even looking at the application. In many cases (like the<br />silly "kill -9" thing) the problem is _soo_ much more easily solved in<br />user space that anybody who even thinks "kernel" is just completely out to<br />lunch. <br /><br />For example, NOBODY has come up with a very real concern - that of<br />revoking direct graphics card privileges from a process. THAT is something<br />you need kernel support for, because regardless of whether you do various<br />video mode switching stuff etc in a loadable kernel module or in a<br />user-level deamon, nobody in their right mind would suggest that you don't<br />allow some direct hardware access to the application that writes to the<br />screen. <br /><br />To me, this just makes me feel that none of the people here have thought<br />it through AT ALL. And quite frankly, before you've thought it through,<br />you should not think about kernels. <br /><br />So my argument is really not one against adding features to the kernel. I<br />do that every effing day. My argument is about people obviously not having<br />spent one _ounce_ of common sense on the problems before spouting off<br />about needing kernel support. <br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html">http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
