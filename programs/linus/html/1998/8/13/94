There is no race, because the _only_ thing that changes the video<br />&gt; &gt; mode is the deamon. NOTHING else. So when the deamon decides to change<br />&gt; &gt; modes, it can do so - and doesn't ask anything for permission.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Ok right. Now I see your model with that bit. The X server "traditional<br />&gt; sense" sends a message to the "not X server" to do the mode shift. And<br />&gt; the notXserver piece is the is the small module thats not the user<br />&gt; and has to be correct. <br /><br />Yes. Mode shifts are not performance critical (yet it is obviously<br />critical that you can do them regardless of what happens to the main<br />graphics part), so it makes sense to have those parts done by an external<br />"more trusted" entity that does nothing but mode shift.<br /><br />So when the X server wants to shift modes due to Ctrl-Alt-'+'/'-', it just<br />tells the mode server to do it for it (sending a signal, or having a pipe<br />open when it forked it off or whatever).<br /><br />Notice that X already used to do something like this. Remember back when<br />XFree86 didn't know enough about some graphics card clock drivers, and<br />with some cards you had to use an external command to set the graphics<br />clock? I don't think they do that any more, but the point is that X has<br />had "external" help for things like this before too.. <br /><br />And then, whether that "more trusted" entity is a kernel module or a<br />deamon or whatever is immaterial as far as I'm concerned, and I wouldn't<br />have any problems with XF86 just doing an "insmod" instead of forking a<br />process. However, forking a separate process has many advantages, not the<br />least of which is portability (XF86 still works on other architectures<br />than Linux).<br /><br />And even more importantly - I think that the _first_ step should be to do<br />it in user land, and only once people have shown that it doesn't work that<br />way should they consider a kernel approach. Again, I want to complain<br />about the fact that people just automatically thought this needed lots of<br />kernel support, obviously without ever even thinking about user-level<br />approaches. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html">http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
