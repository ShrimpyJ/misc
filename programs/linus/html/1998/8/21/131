Which is why I've<br />&gt; just asked for other folks to look over that.<br /><br />Ok. Peace. <br /><br />&gt; So we appear to now be getting signals. Fine, whats wrong with that signal<br />&gt; blocking code ? And if that code is ok  what the hell is going on. The<br />&gt; two cases I re-enabled are both now (2.1.117) covered by that protection.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I didnt just blunder into this. I did actually do my homework ...<br /><br />To me it appeared very much like a blunder. When I looked at your changes<br />to the write code it because very obvious very immediately that it was<br />broken, and as such I assumed it was that you just were floundering around<br />like a beached whale. <br /><br />Sadly, the obvious breakage wasn't the kind I could blame the problems on. <br />The obvious breakage is that even though you disabled the IS_SOFT testing<br />for pending signals, you didn't do the "current-&gt;state" thing right. Do<br />you now wonder why I thought you were just completely out to lunch? <br /><br />However, it was very obvious that making current-&gt;state right could only<br />make matters worse, so I'm left with:<br /> - I have broken code<br /> - the fix I _can_ do is not going to fix what people report<br /> - I'm in a code-freeze, and this guy who wrote obviously broken code has<br />   been sending me these patches for NFS over TCP, I'm assuming this is<br />   some half-assed attempt to fix something there. <br /><br />In short, I may have over-reacted. Sorry. But I'm still going to revert<br />that, because right now 2.1.117 looked _very_ good, and whatever you say<br />about the current NFS, it is stable. It has one known (but yet<br />unexplained) bug with regards to O_APPEND, and it has nasty behaviour when<br />the NFS server doesn't reply, but it's certainly been stable for quite<br />some time. <br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html">http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
