Currently Im trying to measure them all. The more messages<br />&gt; I get from people detailing corruption cases the better.<br /><br />I don't need to "measure" it. <br /><br />I have a very clear report of a person who could reproduce the behaviour<br />at will.<br /><br />It went away when he turned off IDEDMA.<br /><br />To prove a theory you need lots of people. To _disprove_ something you<br />only need a single case. <br /><br />And yes, he couldn't reproduce it at will without SMP. Which may mean that<br />there is a SMP problem, but is equally likely to mean that with SMP<br />enabled the machine had enough memory load that the DMA problems started<br />occurring because the timings were so tight. <br /><br />&gt; Or just run FreeBSD, which doesn't seem to be having any such problems.<br /><br />Or has about .5% of the user base. Yes.<br /><br />Do you remember the problems we had with interrupts enabled during data<br />transfers? It was a real problem, and again "just run FreeBSD, it doesn't<br />have the problem" came up as a solution. Sure, it doesn't have the<br />problem, because it doesn't have the hardware or the user base. <br /><br />Anyway, I'm still open to the possibility that it's something else. It<br />could be extremely timing-dependent, and the person who could reproduce<br />his corruption easily might just have "just the right timings" until he<br />turned off IDE-DMA. <br /><br />BUT: Whatever you claim, there _have_ been pervasive reports about<br />problems with IDE-DMA, for a long time. I've asked people to turn of DMA<br />before, exactly because the rumors have been there. We _know_ that our IDE<br />driver seems to be much too timing-sensitive for some reason, without ever<br />reporting errors even when they happen. Whether that's hardware or the<br />driver is secondary - the fact is that problems have magically gone away<br />when IDEDMA is turned off or when using a shorter cable.<br /><br />And yes, in the Free/NetBSD camp it _is_ acceptable to say "don't use too<br />long a cable". That's the kind of mentality they have. With Linux,<br />however, we want to get people who have never in their life opened their<br />machine, and don't know whether the IDE spec says the cable can be 11" or<br />14" long. To those kinds of users the only right behaviour is to default<br />to the safest possible combination, and then allow the technical users the<br />possibility to (a) check that their hardware is ok and (b) turn on the<br />aggressive modes. <br /><br />In short, you should not force users to have cutting-edge hardware. You<br />should not live at the edge of the spec software-wise, because you know<br />there is hardware out there that is sub-spec. A good driver takes sub-spec<br />hardware into account, whereas a bad drivers says "your hardware is<br />sub-spec, so screw you". <br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html">http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
