As<br />&gt; &gt; far as I can tell the only sane thing is to have it always disabled by<br />&gt; &gt; default, and enable it with hdparm.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Its a factor of 10 speedup in effective throughput. It was turned on by<br />&gt; the BIOS - which may have configured aspects of the firmware we don't even<br />&gt; know about for DMA only operation.<br /><br />BUT THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF CORRUPTION WITH IDE-DMA FOR TOO LONG, AND<br />WE'RE READYING FOR A STABLE RELEASE! <br /><br />I don't buy into the BIOS argument. I've heard it before, and it sounds<br />completely bogus to me. If you're running Win3.11, the BIOS will have done<br />the same thing, and I know win3.11 doesn't use DMA in its native driver. <br />And I bet they tested that configuration. In short, whoever came up with<br />the argument that "if the BIOS tells us that it can do DMA, we must follow<br />that" is just out to lunch or is trying to reach for any reason to keep it<br />enabled. <br /><br />The argument is proven false by the fact that people who saw corruption<br />with DMA on didn't see it with DMA off. In short, my counter-argument is<br />that we _know_ that DMA is unsafe. Rather than wild and idle speculation,<br />we have FACTS. And when it comes to fact vs wild speculation, I'll go with<br />the facts any day. <br /><br />Quite frankly, as long as the IDE driver defaults to DMA on when<br />configured with IDEDMA, the IDEDMA thing won't be visible by default. I<br />categorically refuse to have an option that is known to cause various<br />silent corruptions. It was fine in a development series, but sorry, it's<br />no longer acceptable. <br /><br />And yes, Alan, it's trivial to get 10 times throughput improvement by<br />being buggy. I can calculate PI to 20 billion digits in less than two<br />seconds if I'm not required to actually get the right answer. Does that<br />make my computer a supercomputer?<br /><br />For people who care about performance, there already _is_ a DMA flag to<br />hdparm, and you should be able to enable it from your /etc/rc.d scripts by<br />just running hdparm. <br /><br />For people that don't know about these corruption issues, the _only_ sane<br />default is to leave the DMA code turned off. Unless you have some way of<br />categorically making sure that it is absolutely safe to turn on, and so<br />far I haven't heard of any (a white-list is probably the best answer, but<br />I'd argue for keeping the white-list in user space where it belongs, and<br />just have a script in rc.d to parse the BIOS/PCI information). <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html">http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
