I wouldn't be in the least<br />surprised if it is a hardware problem, and I've tried to be careful not to<br />blame driver bugs in my emails by saying so. <br /><br />In fact, my personal belief is that it _is_ a hardware problem, with too<br />tight timings making it appear. And I would also believe Gadi and Mark<br />almost implicitly if they tell me that the driver is "within spec". <br /><br />My personal suspicion is that we're _just_ aggressive enough to make a few<br />machines unhappy. Very obviously the IDE driver works beatifully on 99% of<br />all machines, which is why I don't think there is anything major wrong<br />with the thing ("major wrong" would be to start the DMA on a write, and<br />release the request before the full write has been done, for example).<br /><br />It's just that I personally think that even if on just 1% of machines we<br />have occasional problems because 1% fo all machines are sub-spec, then we<br />shouldn't default to being as aggressive as we are. <br /><br />(And I actually suspect that in the PC world, the "1%" is closer to 10% or<br />something, it's just that a few machines are _so_ much out of spec that it<br />then shows up). <br /><br />And THAT is why I think we should default to something slower and safer,<br />and then continue to look into the problem (because we'd still like to<br />know why it happens, just in case..) <br /><br />For example, what makes me suspicios is that for the person I was talking<br />to, the problems showed up between 102 and 103. I've now looked at the 102<br />patch too, and there is absolutely nothing there related to filesystems<br />that looks even slightly suspicious.<br /><br />The ide driver itself didn't change very much, but what _did_ change was<br /> - the cyrix code was removed. That code would accidentally overwrite the<br />   DMA registers on BX motherboards, and it is just possible that by<br />   mistake would make DMA work better (slowing down the timings or<br />   something)<br /> - the interrupt code path for SMP was speeded up and simplified (and<br />   finally fixed - this was the first release that got the pending<br />   interrupts right) <br /><br />Essentially, everything I found looked more like timing changes, not like<br />some fundamental bug. Which is why I'm suspicious of timing and hardware<br />issues. <br /><br />Yes, timing changes can make a latent fundamental bug show up, no question<br />about that. But at least to me it just looks more like a "simple" hardware<br />timing thing than anything else right now. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html">http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
