It<br />&gt; claimed that neither drive had any errors.  So I ran .109 SMP again.<br />&gt; After a couple untar/rm tests, the errors came back.  I forced a fsck and<br />&gt; recompiled the kernel UP.  So far under the UP kernel, the untar/rm test<br />&gt; and several compiles yield no errors.  So I'm guessing this might be a SMP<br />&gt; issue. <br /><br />Could you do a few tests for me? As it stands, you're the only one<br />reporting this so far, so.. <br /><br />The tests are roughly:<br /> - can you disable IDE-DMA with hdparm? Does the problem go away? It so<br />   happens that 2.1.103 stopped doing a nasty thing to the motherboard if<br />   you happen to have a PPro or a Pentium II, and the nasty that it did<br />   was to overwrite a DMA setup register. That was a bug for others, but<br />   it might have been hiding another bug for you..<br /> - can you try to pinpoint which kernel this started at for you? Your<br />   first email said it seems to have started at 2.1.103, can you verify<br />   that 2.1.102 indeed works for you even with SMP, but 2.1.103 does not,<br />   or was the 2.1.103 just a rough guess?<br /> - if it is indeed 2.1.103, can you check whether reverting the changes to<br />   the IDE driver that happened between 2.1.102 and 103 makes a<br />   difference? <br /><br />If nothing else seems to make a difference, I'd also ask you to as a last<br />test check:<br /><br /> - use an older gcc instead of the egcs-1.0.3a compiler that you seem to<br />   be using. Just to get one variation out of the picture.<br /><br />I don't think this is a filesystem problem, or I'd have been getting a lot<br />more reports about it (and judging by how easily it happens to you I<br />should have seen it myself). But there have been occasional grumblings<br />about IDE DMA..<br /><br />Mark, Gadi, any suggestions to try to either pinpoint the IDE driver or to<br />show that it isn't a driver issue?<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html">http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
