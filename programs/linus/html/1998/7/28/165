If anyone thinks they know of such a case,<br />&gt; I'd be happy to investigate it .. but all such cases thus far have<br />&gt; been proven bogus.<br /><br />Have you been closing your eyes when the reports go past, or what?<br /><br />If you by "all such cases thus far have been proven bogus" mean that so<br />far you have been able to blame a too-long cable or something else like<br />that, then sure. I can imagine that all DMA corruption problems can be<br />adequately explained by something being out-of-spec, whether it's the<br />cable or the chipset being bad. <br /><br />But that doesn't change the fact that people see corruption that goes away<br />when they disable DMA. <br /><br />Think back a few years to the case where you had to disable interrupts<br />during the transfer. I could have argued that the hardware was broken,<br />because according to the specs it shouldn't have been needed. I didn't.  I<br />made the default be the safe and slow one, even though I didn't need it<br />myself and had personally never seen a machine that had ever needed it.<br /><br />I had _one_ report of it that was consistent - he coult turn the interrupt<br />disable code on and off and it could corrupt or not corrupt reliably after<br />some time. One is all it takes. I didn't ask him whether he was<br />overclocking his bus, or try to make excuses by asking how long the cable<br />was. I fixed the problem. <br /><br />Quite frankly, if you're not willing to fix the problem, I don' thave any<br />other recourse than to disable the IDEDMA option. I refuse to ship kernels<br />that have known instabilities, and I consider "tight timing" to be an<br />instability. <br /><br />You should have noted that I at no time blamed the driver itself. I don't<br />have any gripes with the DMA code itself. The thing I consider to be a bug<br />is that it enables it by default, even though we have reports of it<br />corrupting disks on certain machines. <br /><br />The _only_ thing I ask for is that DMA be disabled by default, or at least<br />disabled when there is any reasonable cause fr doubting the hardware.<br />David Miller reports that certain windows drivers have a black-list, and<br />that may be what we need to have. It certainly indicates that somebody<br />else is aware of problems. <br /><br />If you want to stick your head in the sand and ignore it, I can't do<br />anything about that. I don't know the IDE driver well enough to start<br />doing this, so I used a sledgehammer approach rather than trying to be<br />subtle. I'd much prefer a subtle fix, but before the subtle fix is in<br />place I won't remove the sledgehammer one. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html">http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
