Also, thank yous go out to everyone and anyone who as<br />contributed to Linux.  I wanted to congratulate Mr. Torvalds on his article<br />in Forbes magazine.  You are turning into quite a celebrity!  Keep up the<br />good work!<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Sid Boyce writes:<br />	I well remember 1992 when I was on a 10 week class in Dublin and downloaded the<br />first release of Linux. I could just boot it on the 2 Meg laptop I had. When I<br />got home, I cleared one of my partitions, installed it and quickly realised that<br />it looked very useful, especially compared with my Minix and the porting<br />difficulties I experienced there.<br />	One day, I suddenly realised I didn't need Minix on my machine anymore, just<br />"shoelace" was left to boot up with.<br />	I was not put off by Prof. Tannenbaum bemoaning that Linux was not going<br />anywhere because it was a monolithic kernel, to me it looked damned good.<br />	I think right back then I realised this was something out of the ordinary and<br />soon it made light of the efforts of the Williams Company.<br />	Linus is certainly worth the accolades he gets, it was a visionary move whether<br />realised it at the time or not, sometimes all it takes to cause an avalanche is<br />the movement of one snowflake.<br />	I have seen many attempts in the past to rank Linux as 5th. rate, I've heard<br />taunts of "Boy's Own Unix" to equate here in the UK with the old Boy's Own<br />comic. An impressive list of about turns can be seen now. There are still<br />detractors, some of whom will be using Linux in the future. I always reckon that<br />even negative publicity is good for the spread of Linux.<br />	Linus couldn't have done a better job with a 100 million dollar glisty TV ad<br />campaign and the competition is increasingly looking like her ladyship, fur coat<br />and no knickers, they know it as they watch their wardrobes burn.<br />	I would join your sentiments to the full team of contributors.<br />Regards	<br />-- <br />...
