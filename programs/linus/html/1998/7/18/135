But I don't really know what I'm talking about, just overhear<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Uhumm and I thought the exact opposite was true. At least I originally<br />&gt;moved away from 2.0.32 because the box became absolutely unusable after<br />&gt;5 or so days. I have been running 2.1.[96-105] for upto 30 days and I<br />&gt;don't see any problems. (sound works, X doesn't get jerky and so on)<br />&gt;<br />&gt;As I see it the 2.1 fragmentation issues have seen the daylight in the<br />&gt;past 2 months or so, can't say exactly when.<br /><br />Fragmentation isn't the issue.  As of 2.1.109 you shouldn't have to<br />worry, and even if you did it wouldn't show up as bad performance but as<br />fork() failures (and if you get a fork() failure while rebuilding the<br />kernel you'd get a failed kernel build, not a slow one). <br /><br />The issue is that<br /> - Linux uses more memory for caching. Dentries use up memory, and if<br />   you used to be low on memory before, 2.1.x is going to be even lower<br />   on memory.  And once you're paging, you aren't going to have good<br />   performance. <br /><br />   In particular, a kernel compile probably first into 8MB on 2.0.x (not<br />   comfortable, but not excatly uncomfortable either). But in 2.1.x the<br />   working set is suddenly larger - and you end up paging.<br /><br /> - The page aging is wrong, at least for low-memory circumstances.<br />   Stephen Tweedie posted an interesting result where disabling page<br />   aging completely made the thing run a lot faster.<br /><br />Essentially, we use more memory than we used to, and to make matters<br />worse we don't throw out the right thing when we notice that we're low<br />on memory.<br /><br />What 2.1.109 does is:<br /> - fragmentation isn't really an issue any more (except for NFS, where<br />   it has always been an issue, including in 2.0.x). HOWEVER, the amount<br />   of free memory still is an issue - see above.<br /> - much nicer swap-out, and better "no-memory" behaviour ("no-memory<br />   behaviour" is the point where it decides that it's really run out of<br />   swap and needs to start refusing allocations)<br /><br />So what 2.1.109 does is to make the machine usable under low memory<br />conditions, but 2.1.109 does _not_ fix the page aging issue, not does it<br />change the fact that we use more memory for dentries.<br /><br />(Note that using more memory for dentries is not something that is ever<br />going to be fixed - it's an integral part of 2.1.x, but as with the page<br />aging we probably use the _wrong_ memory, so the aging of memory is<br />again a big issue). <br /><br />Some of the behaviour you can tune at run-time, and that may actually be<br />a big thing already.  In particular, check out the /proc/sys/vm/freepages<br />file: it contains three numbers that essentially specify how much memory<br />the machine tries to keep free..  You can tweak the numbers a bit to see<br />how that changes the behaviour of your system.. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html">http://www.altern.org/andrebalsa/doc/lkml-faq.html</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
