Tweedie wrote:<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Indeed.  However, I think it misses the real advantage, which is that<br />&gt; the mechanism would be inherently self-tuning (much more so than the<br />&gt; existing code).<br /><br />Yes, that's one of the reasons I like it.<br /><br />The other reason I like it is that right now it is extremely hard to share<br />swapped out pages unless you share them due to a fork(). The problem is<br />that the swap cache supports the notion of sharing, but out swap-out<br />routines do not - they swap things out on a per-virtual-page basis, and<br />that results in various nasty things - we page out the same page to<br />multiple places, and lose the sharing. <br /><br />&gt; &gt; I'd like to see this, although I think it's way too late for 2.2<br />&gt; <br />&gt; The mechanism is all there, and we're just tuning policy.  Frankly,<br />&gt; the changes we've seen in vm policy since 2.1.125 are pretty major<br />&gt; already, and I think it's important to get it right before 2.2.0.<br /><br />The VM policy changes weren't stability issues, they were only "timing". <br />As such, if they broke something, it was really broken before too. <br /><br />And I agree that the mechanism is already there, however as it stands we<br />really populate the swap cache at page-in rather than page-out, and<br />changing that is fairly fundamental. It would be good, no question about<br />it, but it's still fairly fundamental. <br /><br />Note that if done right, this would also fix the damn stupid dirty page<br />write-back thing: right now if multiple processes share the same dirty<br />page and they all write to it, it will be written multiple times. But done<br />right, the dirty inode page write-out would be done the same way. <br /><br />&gt; The patch below is a very simple implementation of this concept.<br /><br />I will most probably apply the patch - it just looks fundamentally<br />correct. However, what I was thinking of was a bit more ambitious.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
