If you use NFS heavily, you _will_ notice this change (it<br />also fixes some rather ugly uses of dentries and inodes in the NFS code<br />where we didn't update the counter so the inode wasn't guaranteed to even<br />be there any more!). <br /><br />Also, thanks to Richard Gooch &amp;co, who found the rather nasty race<br />condition when a kernel thread was started from an init-region. The<br />trivial fix was to not have the kernel thread function be inlined, but<br />while fixing it was trivial, it wasn't trivial to notice in the first<br />place. Good debugging.<br /><br />And the UP flu is obviously fixed here (as it was in earlier pre-patches<br />and in various other patches floating around).<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
