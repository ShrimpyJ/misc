Looks suspicious. In particular, it<br />looks like a TX interrupt could occur while the new TX entry hasn't been<br />filled in yet (this same thing is done in three places in set_rx_mode(). <br /><br />The above may not be the reason for the problems, but it looks like one<br />potential thing to look at for somebody who knows the driver.<br /><br />The locking in general looks fairly strange. There's a very simple scheme<br />that works beautifully for both SMP and UP, and on UP generates minimal<br />code:<br /><br /> - add a per-controller "controller spinlock":<br /><br />	spinlock_t eepro100_lock = SPIN_LOCK_UNLOCKED;<br /><br /> - the per-controller interrupt handler does a<br /><br />	spin_lock(&amp;eepro100_lock);<br />	... do all controller accesses inside this lock ...<br />	spin_unlock(&amp;eepro100_lock);<br /><br />   which on UP compiles to no code at all, because on UP a normal spinlock<br />   just doesn't need to do anything. So you don't have to worry about any<br />   performance impact.<br /><br />   NOTE! The above only works if it's a per-interrupt lock. If you have a<br />   driver that supports multiple controllers, the lock has to be a<br />   per-controller lock and be associated with only one interrupt. Or you<br />   have to protect against deadlocks by disabling interrupts locally.<br /><br /> - A non-interrupt context does<br /><br />	unsigned long flags;<br />	spin_lock_irqsave(&amp;eepro100_lock, flags);<br />	... do all controller accesses inside this lock ...<br />	spin_unlock_irqrestore(&amp;eepro100_lock, flags);<br /><br />   which on UP just boils down to a normal save_flags+cli thing, ie the<br />   same as what you have now. On SMP, it's a much faster spinlock rather<br />   than the global IRQ lock.<br /><br />So the above is equivalent to what you do now on UP, and much faster and<br />more robust than what the current code does now on SMP. <br /><br />The reason the spin-lock has to be a per-controller thing is that when you<br />get the lock without disabling local interrupts (which is good, because<br />it's much faster that way) you have to guarantee that you can't have<br />recursion. For a single interrupt source, the interrupt handling<br />guarantees that, but if you try to share the lock across multiple<br />controllers with multiple interrupt sources you could get deadlock<br />situations when you get "nested" interrupts on different controllers. <br /><br />Alternatively, you can have one global lock for many drivers, but then you<br />have to use the "irqsave" version for all lock accesses. Which is slower,<br />and not "as pretty". <br /><br />Oh, btw, it looks like "set_rx_mode()" is called from within timers. Which<br />makes it all the more imperative to use spinlocks, because the global<br />interrupt lock can't protect against interrupts on another CPU from an<br />interrupt context like a timer (more deadlock reasons - imagine two<br />interrupt contexts on two different CPU's trying to do a global lock at<br />the same time, and both wanting to wait for the other to go away).<br /><br />Donald, do you have any SMP machines available to you? I would have<br />assumed that SMP was the next obvious step for beowulf.. I could try to<br />see if my intel contacts are interested.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
