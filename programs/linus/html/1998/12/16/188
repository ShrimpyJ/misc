I'm back from Finland, and have caught<br />up with just about half the email that I got during the stay. However,<br />even the part I caught up with I may have partly missed something in,<br />because (for obvious reasons) I didn't read them as carefully (*) as I<br />usually do.<br /><br />This should fix at least part of the NFS problems people have reported: <br />there was code to completely incorrectly invalidate quite valid write<br />requests under some circumstances. The pre-patch also contains the first<br />batch of patches merged in from Alan, and the "rmdir" problems should be<br />fixed (mostly thanks to Al Viro).<br /><br />This pre-patch also gets rid of some imho completely unnecessary<br />complexity in some of the VM memory freeing routines. There have been<br />patches floating around that added more heuristics on when to do<br />something, and this tries to get the same result by just removing old<br />heuristics that didn't make much sense.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />(*) Even my usual "careful" is not very careful by other peoples<br />standards. So when _I_ say that I wasn't very careful, you should just<br />assume that I was reading my email about as carefully as a hyper-active<br />hedgehog on some serious uppers. Can you say "ignored email" three times<br />quickly while chewing on an apple? <br /><br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
