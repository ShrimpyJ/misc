And I obviously never saw it because I don't carry ancient<br />compiler versions.<br /><br />That said:<br /><br />&gt; -       default "-Wimplicit-fallthrough=5" if CC_IS_GCC<br />&gt; +       default "-Wimplicit-fallthrough=5" if $(cc-option,-Wimplicit-fallthrough=5)<br /><br />I think it would be better to keep the CC_IS_GCC part of the test, for<br />the simple reason that the clang "make config" is already very slow.<br /><br />I'm not sure why, but it's annoyingly noticeable, and I've complained<br />about clang performance before in this area (and the likely cause is<br />the default build for clang being this horribly inefficient shared<br />library setup, so it spends ages just doing dynamic linking)<br /><br />Whenever I do "make oldconfig" with a clang build, and my machine is<br />under any reasonable load (typically because I'm also doing another<br />build in another terminal at the same time), it takes several seconds.<br /><br />Doing the same thing with gcc is noticeably much faster.<br /><br />In fact, it doesn't even need to be a very loaded machine, this is<br />basically an empty "re-do config" with gcc vs clang (basically same<br />config, except obviously for compiler-induced config differences):<br /><br />  gcc$ time make oldconfig<br />  real 0m0.929s<br /><br />  clang$ time make oldconfig<br />  real 0m1.917s<br /><br />Two seconds may not seem like a lot, but when the machine is under my<br />usual build load, that almost 2s easily becomes a "do I need to go for<br />coffee" delay, since I'm just waiting for the config to finish before<br />I start the build (since I may end up having to answer questions).<br /><br />And yeah, it's sad how much faster gcc is.<br /><br />There was a time when the clang people were proud of their<br />compile-time performance. Pepperidge farm remembers.<br /><br />Anyway, I'd prefer to not ask for the clang build to do even more<br />work, since we know it will fail that '=5' case.<br /><br />             Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
