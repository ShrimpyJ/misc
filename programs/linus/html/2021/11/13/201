It may still be seeing more testing and development before that<br />pull happens, though.<br /><br />This very much smells of what the "branch description" is all about, but<br /><br /> (a) I suspect "git branch --edit-description" is not very well known<br /><br /> (b) it works well with "git request-pull", but not so much some other<br />things (like copying it into a signed tag)<br /><br /> (c) it makes an unholy mess of your config file if you actually use<br />it for extensive explanations (branch descriptions _work_ for<br />multi-line messages, but it really was designed as a one-liner thing).<br /><br /> (d) it doesn't work across repositories (ie multiple developers or<br />even just a single developer on multiple machines).<br /><br />IOW, the "branch description" is _kind_ of the right thing, but not really.<br /><br />The fake merge _does_ solve all these issues, it just then ends up<br />leaving that turd around in the history.<br /><br />An empty commit would do it as well, but an empty commit very easily<br />gets lost (git rebase etc). The fake merge does have similar issues.<br /><br />Both a fake merge, and an empty commit have the advantage that they<br />are easy to see and work with (ie "git log" and all the other git<br />workflows work very naturally).<br /><br />Comments from git people?<br /><br />                Linus<br /><br />On Fri, Nov 5, 2021 at 9:38 AM Eric W.
