People who want the self-flagellation can enable them with W=1<br />(or bigger values), and spend their life fighting stupid random<br />compiler warnings that have tons of false positives.<br /><br />But the fact is, I've required a warning-free build on x86-64 for<br />anything I notice for the last several years by now, and it really<br />hasn't been a problem.<br /><br />What _has_ been a problem is that (a) build bots don't care about and<br />(b) the configs I don't personally test (other non-x86-64<br />architectures stand out, but there's certainly been other<br />configuration issues too).<br /><br />But "bogus compiler warnings" is very much *not* in that list of problems.<br /><br />I've looked at a lot of the warnings that are now errors, and while a<br />number of them have made me go "So why didn't we see that on x86-64?"<br />not one of them has actually made me go "-Werror was wrong".<br /><br />Because EVERY single one I've seen has been for something that should<br />have been fixed. Presumably long long ago, but the warning it<br />generated had been ignored.<br /><br />So stop with the "some warnings just happen" crap. Outside of actual<br />compiler bugs, and truly stupid warnings (that we turn off), that's<br />simply not true.<br /><br />And yes, those compiler bugs happen. The new warning already found one<br />issue with current gcc trunk (non-released). So right now the count is<br />"lots of valid warnings, and one compiler bug that was found _thanks_<br />to me enabling -Werror".<br /><br />Yes, we have issues with having to work around older compiler bugs.<br />Those aren't going away, and yes, -Werror may well mean that<br />non-x86-64 people now have to deal with them.<br /><br />And yes, this is painful. I'm very much aware of that. But we just<br />need to do it. Because the warnings don't go away on their own, and<br />not making them fatal clearly just means that they'll stay around<br />forever.<br /><br />           Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
