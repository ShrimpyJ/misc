I'm sensitive about the cred pointer because of the<br />timing, but I'm also sensitive about just looking at code and saying<br />"that makes no sense".<br /><br />Having callers do pointless things that make no sense to the callers<br />is a bad thing. Having a patch where 59 out of 63 callers just<br />mindlessly pass in "current_cred()", and then remaining three callers<br />pass in NULL for NO DISCERNIBLE REASON is a sign of just a bad<br />interface.<br /><br />And I realize that to you, these interfaces are what you do.<br /><br />To everybody else, it's completely mindless noise that makes no sense<br />at all, because there's no _logic_ to it. It's random LSM calls in<br />random contexts that have no clear reason for them, because the<br />"reason" is hidden in some odd SELinux rule that no kernel developer<br />even knows about.<br /><br />You can't even grep for the use of it, because there is none. It's<br />literally randomness. Which means that it _has_ to make conceptual<br />sense to be at all maintainable.<br /><br />So when I see a diffstat where basically 90% of the patch has<br />ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with SElinux or anything you maintain, and<br />that 90% makes absolutely no sense to begin with, guess what? I think<br />that patch is bad.<br /><br />When I then look closer, and see that the _reason_ for the patch is<br />that SElinux - yet again - incorrectly accessed process credentials in<br />random contexts, I just do "this is not just a bad patch, this is<br />actually a fundamental problem with SELinux".<br /><br />See where I'm coming from? The "specific security model for lockdown"<br />is just the high-level view of what made sense. You violated that view<br />for bad reasons, with a bad patch, and with bad timing.<br /><br />This isn't _just_ a SElinux problem. I think it's a LSM problem in<br />general. Lots of those random callbacks are completely<br />incomprehensible, have odd rules, and the LSM people aren't even<br />trying to have them make sense.<br /><br />As long as the oddity is contained, that's one thing. But when it is<br />made this obvious and affects random code in strange places in the<br />kernel, and it's for a feature that had a lot of discussion even when<br />it got merged, I'm putting my foot down.<br /><br />             Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
