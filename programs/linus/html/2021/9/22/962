The silence isn't some "deep" thing.<br /><br />What  happened is literally that I wasn't 100% happy with the naming,<br />but didn't hate the patches, and still don't.<br /><br />But when there is still active discussion about them during the merge<br />window, I'm just not going to merge them.<br /><br />The silence literally is just due to that - not participating in the<br />discussion for the simple reason that I had no hugely strong opinions<br />on my side - but also simply because there is no way I'd merge this<br />for 5.15 simply exactly _because_ of this discussion.<br /><br />Normally I get to clean up my inbox the week after the merge window,<br />but the -Werror things kept my attention for one extra week, and so my<br />mailbox has been a disaster area as a result. So only today does my<br />inbox start to look reasonable again after the merge window (not<br />because of the extra email during the merge window, but simply because<br />the merge window causes me to ignore non-pull emails, and then I need<br />to go back and check the other stuff afterwards).<br /><br />So I'm not particularly unhappy with the patchset. I understand where<br />it is coming from, I have no huge technical disagreement with it<br />personally.<br /><br />That said, I'm not hugely _enthused_ about the mm side of it either,<br />which is why I also wouldn't just override the discussion and say<br />"that's it, I'm merging it". I basically wanted to see if it led<br />somewhere.<br /><br />I'm not convinced it led anywhere, but that didn't really change<br />things for me, except for the "yeah, I'm not merging something core<br />like this while it's under active discussion" part.<br /><br />           Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
