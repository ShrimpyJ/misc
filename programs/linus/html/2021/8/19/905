The "signed pointer"<br />warnings could catch things too if people really care about "unsigned<br />char *" vs just plain "char *".<br /><br />But warnings that have too many false positives are more likely to<br />hide bugs than expose them. So it's very much a balancing act.<br /><br />I personally think that false positives are deadly: I'd much rather<br />have a c completely clean build where are the warnings are big red<br />flags, than a build that has warnings that _may_ be signs of bugs, but<br />where you have known false positives that have no sane workaround.<br /><br />Because with even a _single_ false positive, people will immediately<br />just stop caring about any other warnings at all. We've seen that over<br />and over again.<br /><br />This is why a compiler warning - to be useful - has to be completely<br />unambiguously about bad code, or at least have a alternate "good code<br />pattern" that is no worse than the code that the warning about.<br /><br />&gt; However, if you are truly opposed to a version check, can we at least<br />&gt; just check for the presence of -Wunreachable-code-fallthrough as I<br />&gt; suggested before?<br /><br />I'm ok with that, since at that point there are no false warnings.<br /><br />But even then, it's much too late for 5.14 by now, considering that<br />this has had issues, and that we already enable the warnings on the<br />common gcc builds.<br /><br />                Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
