That would match fault_in_iov_iter_writeable, which<br />&gt; is modeled after __mm_populate and which skips VM_IO and VM_PFNMAP<br />&gt; vmas.<br /><br />I don't understand what you mean.. GUP already skips VM_IO (and<br />VM_PFNMAP) pages. It just returns EFAULT.<br /><br />We could make it return another error. We already have DAX and<br />FOLL_LONGTERM returning -EOPNOTSUPP.<br /><br />Of course, I think some code ends up always just returning "number of<br />pages looked up" and might return 0 for "no pages" rather than the<br />error for the first page.<br /><br />So we may end up having interfaces that then lose that explanation<br />error code, but I didn't check.<br /><br />But we couldn't make it just say "skip them and try later addresses",<br />if that is what you meant. THAT makes no sense - that would just make<br />GUP look up some other address than what was asked for.<br /><br />&gt; &gt; I also do still think that even regardless of that, we want to just<br />&gt; &gt; add a FOLL_NOFAULT flag that just disables calling handle_mm_fault(),<br />&gt; &gt; and then you can use the regular get_user_pages().<br />&gt; &gt;<br />&gt; &gt; That at least gives us the full _normal_ page handling stuff.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; And it does fix the generic/208 failure.<br /><br />Good. So I think the approach is usable, even if we might have corner<br />cases left.<br /><br />So I think the remaining issue is exactly things like VM_IO and<br />VM_PFNMAP. Do the fstests have test-cases for things like this? It<br />_is_ quite specialized, it might be a good idea to have that.<br /><br />Of course, doing direct-IO from special memory regions with zerocopy<br />might be something special people actually want to do. But I think<br />we've had that VM_IO flag testing there basically forever, so I don't<br />think it has ever worked (for some definition of "ever").<br /><br />            Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
