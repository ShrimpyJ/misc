And Andreas' solution (based on my suggestion) is<br />the exact same one that we have had for that code since basically day<br />#1.<br /><br />The whole "0/-EFAULT" is simpler, yes. And it's what<br />"{get|put}_user()" uses, yes. And it's more common to a lot of other<br />functions that return zero or an error.<br /><br />But see above. People *need* that ternary result, and "bytes/pages<br />uncopied" is not only the traditional one we use elsewhere in similar<br />situations, it's the one that has the easiest error tests for existing<br />users (because zero remains "everything worked").<br /><br />Andreas originally had that "how many bytes/pages succeeded" return<br />value instead, and yes, that's also ternary. But it means that now the<br />common "complete success" test ends up being a lot uglier, and the<br />semantics of the function changes completely where "0" no longer means<br />success, and that messes up much more.<br /><br />So I really think you are barking entirely up the wrong tree.<br /><br />If there is any inconsistency, maybe we should make _more_ cases use<br />that "how many bytes/pages not copied" logic, but in a lot of cases<br />you don't actually need the ternary decision value.<br /><br />So the inconsistency is EXACTLY the same as the one we have always had<br />for get|put_user() vs copy_to|from_user(), and it exists for the EXACT<br />same reason.<br /><br />IOW, please explain how you'd solve the ternary problem without making<br />the code a lot uglier.<br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
