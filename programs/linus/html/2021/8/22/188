You just have to jump through a few hoops.<br /><br />&gt; Maybe it is all completely silly and we should not care about the code<br />&gt; that thinks /proc/self/exe is a reliable measure of anything, but short<br />&gt; of that I think we should either keep the code or put in some careful<br />&gt; thought as to which restrictions make sense when changing<br />&gt; /proc/self/exe.<br /><br />I think the important ones are already there: checking that it is (a)<br />an executable and (b) that we have execute permission to it.<br /><br />I also think the code is actually racy - while we are checking "did<br />the old mm_exe file have any mappings", there's nothing that keeps<br />another thread from changing the exe file to another one that _does_<br />have mappings, and then we'll happily replace it with yet another file<br />because we checked the old one, not the new one it was replaced by in<br />the meantime.<br /><br />Of course, that "race" doesn't really matter - exactly because this<br />isn't about security, it's just a random "let's test that immaterial<br />thing, and we don't actually care about corner cases".<br /><br />So I'm not saying that race needs to be fixed - I'm just pointing it<br />out as an example of how nonsensical the test really is. It's not<br />fundamental to anything, it's just a random "let's test this odd<br />condition".<br /><br />That said, I don't care _that_ much. I'm happy with David's series, I<br />just think that once we don't do this at a mmap level any more, the<br />"go look for mappings" code makes little sense.<br /><br />So we can leave it, and remove it later if people agree.<br /><br />                  Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
