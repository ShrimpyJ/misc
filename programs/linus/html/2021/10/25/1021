This is not a complicated rule.<br /><br />If your merge doesn't have an explanation for what you're doing and<br />*WHY* you are doing it, then your merge is bad, bad, bad.<br /><br />Don't do it. Just stop it. Just keep developing your own tree, and<br />don't do bad back-merges of the upstream tree. You have absolutely no<br />business merging my random changes like this, and that is doubly true<br />when you do it badly and the end result is just broken and wrong to<br />the point of not even building.<br /><br />If you really need to do a back-merge, explain WHY. And it had better<br />be some important reason.<br /><br />In particular, the reson should not be "fix conflict", because you're<br />clearly not particularly good at it.<br /><br />Yes, I can screw up merges too. It happens. But I do a _lot_ of<br />merges, and as a result I'm pretty good at them. Trying to fix a<br />conflict so that I don't see it is likely to just make things worse.<br /><br />It makes things worse not only because you're more likely to get it<br />wrong, it makes it worse because it's literally hiding the kinds of<br />development process issues that I want to see so that I am aware of<br />them.<br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
