And request-pull did<br />&gt; not complain about anything.<br /><br />You hadn't pushed the previous case by any chance? 'git request-pull'<br />does actually end up going off to check the remote end, and maybe it<br />saw a stale state (because the mirroring to the public side isn't<br />immediate)?<br /><br />&gt; While I have you - I see that you drop my SoB at the end of the merge<br />&gt; message, usually. Should I not put it there?  I put it there because<br />&gt; of something I read in Documentation/process/...<br /><br />No, I actually like seeing the sign-off from remote pulls -<br />particularly in the signed tags where they get saved in the git tree<br />anyway (you won't _see_ them with a normal 'git log', but you can see<br />how it's saved off if you do<br /><br />    git cat-file commit 180f3bcfe3622bb78307dcc4fe1f8f4a717ee0ba<br /><br />to see the raw commit data).<br /><br />But I edit them out from the merge message because we haven't<br />standardized on a format for them, and I end up trying to make my<br />merges look fairly consistent (I edit just about all merge messages<br />for whitespace and formatting, as you've probably noticed).<br /><br />Maybe we should standardize on sign-off messages for merges too, but<br />they really don't have much practical use.<br /><br />For a patch, the sign-off chain is really important for when some<br />patch trouble happens, so that we can cc all the people involved in<br />merging the patch. And there's obviously the actual copyright part of<br />the sign-off too.<br /><br />For a merge? Neither of those are really issues. The merge itself<br />doesn't add any new code - the sign-offs should be on the individual<br />commits that do. And if there is a merge problem, the blame for the<br />merge is solidly with the person who merged it, not some kind of<br />"merge chain".<br /><br />So all the real meat is in the history, and the merge commit is about<br />explaining the high-level "what's going on".<br /><br />End result: unlike a regular commit, there's not a lot of point for<br />posterity to have a sign-off chain (which would always be just the two<br />ends of the merge anyway). End result: I don't see much real reason to<br />keep the sign-offs in the merge log.<br /><br />But I _do_ like seeing them in the pull request, because there it's<br />kind of the "super-sign-off" for the commits that I pull, if you see<br />what I mean...<br /><br />Logical? I don't know. But hopefully the above explains my thinking.<br /><br />                   Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
