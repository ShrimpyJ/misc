It's hard to see<br />&gt; things from the other person's perspective at times.<br /><br />In just about any other area, I wouldn't mind one bigger patch that<br />just removes code that isn't used.<br /><br />But when it's in the vm code, and it's pretty grotty, I do prefer<br />seeing three patches that individually are much easier to see that<br />"yeah, this doesn't actually change anything at all".<br /><br />The combined patch may be exactly the same thing, it's just much<br />harder to see that "oh, now it's not used any more".<br /><br />That was perhaps especially true since a number of the changes also<br />ended up doing statement simplification when the old layout made no<br />sense any more with part of the results not used.<br /><br />So your 3-patch series was much easier to look at and go "Yeah, I<br />believe each of these patches is a no-op".<br /><br />So ACK on all those patches.<br /><br />          Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
