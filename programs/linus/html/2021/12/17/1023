It's called while holding a very<br />core low-level lock, and it really is supposed to only do a "test".<br />Not some complex operation that may do dynamic memory allocations and<br />sleep.<br /><br />Yet that is exactly what security_sb_mnt_opts_compat() does, as done<br />in 69c4a42d72eb ("lsm,selinux: add new hook to compare new mount to an<br />existing mount").<br /><br />So those two patches are completely broken.<br /><br />Now, commit cc274ae7763d ("selinux: fix sleeping function called from<br />invalid context") that I just merged "fixes" this by making the<br />allocations in parse_sid() be GFP_NOWAIT.<br /><br />That is a *HORRIBLE* fix. It's a horrible fix because<br /><br /> (a) GFP_NOWAIT can fail very easily, causing the mount to randomly<br />fail for non-obvious reasons.<br /><br /> (b) even when it doesn't fail, you really shouldn't do things like<br />this under a very core spinlock.<br /><br />Also, the original place - nfs_compare_mount_options() is called over<br />and over for each mount, so you're parsing those same mount options<br />over and over again. So not only was this sequence buggy, it's really<br />not very smart to begin with.<br /><br />That's why I say that a much better approach would have been to parse<br />the mount options _once_ at the beginning, saving them off in some<br />temporary supoerblock (or whatever - anything that can hold those<br />pre-parsed mount options), and then have the "test" callback literally<br />just check those parsed options.<br /><br />That's not necessarily the only way to go about this - there are<br />probably other approaches too, I didn't really think too much about<br />this. But those two commits on their own are buggy, and the fix is<br />somewhat problematic too.<br /><br />                     Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
