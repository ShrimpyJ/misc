A software bit in the PTE can indicate<br />&gt; “extra software bits” are relevant (to save cache-misses), and a bit<br />&gt; in the PTEs' page-struct indicate whether there is adjacent “extra<br />&gt; software bits” page.<br /><br />Hmm. That doesn't sound very bad, no. And it would be nice to have<br />more software bits (and have them portably).<br /><br />&gt; I don’t think that I am following. The write-protection of UFFD means<br />&gt; that the userspace wants to intervene before anything else (including<br />&gt; COW).<br /><br />The point I was making (badly) is that UFFD_WP is only needed to for<br />the case where the pte isn't already non-writable for other reasons.<br /><br />&gt; UFFD_WP indications are recorded per PTE (i.e., not VMA).<br /><br />The changing of those bits are basically a bastardized 'mprotect()',<br />and does already require the vma to be marked VM_UFFD_WP.<br /><br />And the way you set (or clear) the bits is with a range operation. It<br />really could have been done with mprotect(), and with actual explicit<br />vma bits.<br /><br />The fact that it now uses the page table bit is rather random. I think<br />it would actually be cleaner to make that userfaultfd_writeprotect<br />truly *be* a vma range.<br /><br />Right now it's kind of "half this, half that".<br /><br />Of course, it's possible that because of this situation, some users do<br />a lot of fine-grained VM_UFFD_WP setting, and they kind of expect to<br />not have issues with lots of vma fragments. So practical concerns may<br />have made the implementation set in stone.<br /><br />(I have only ever seen the kernel side of uffd, not the actual user<br />side, so I'm not sure about the use patterns).<br /><br />That said, your suggestion of a shadow sw page table bit thing would<br />also work. And it would solve some problems we have in core areas<br />(notably "page_special()" which right now has that<br />ARCH_HAS_PTE_SPECIAL thing).<br /><br />It would make it really easy to have that "this page table entry is<br />pinned" flag too.<br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
