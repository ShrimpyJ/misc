It would be good if you also added yourself to the MAINTAINERS<br />file. Right now there's no entry for security/safesetid at all.<br /><br />&gt; This is my first time doing one of these pull requests so hopefully I<br />&gt; didn't screw something up.<br /><br />So a couple of notes:<br /><br /> - *please* don't rebase your work in the day before<br /><br />   Was this in linux-next? was this tested at all? Hard to tell, since<br />it was rebased recently, so for all I know it's all completely new<br /><br /> - don't use a random kernel-of-the-day as the base for development<br /><br />   This is related to the rebasing issue, but is true even if you<br />don't rebase. There is no way that it was a good idea to pick my<br />random - possibly completely broken - kernel from Sunday afternoon in<br />the middle of a merge window as a base for development.<br /><br />   If you start development, or if you have to rebase (for some *good*<br />reason) you need to do so on a good stable base, not on the quick-sand<br />that is "random kernel of the day during the busiest merge activity".<br /><br /> - Please use the "git pull-request" format and then add any extra<br />notes you feel are necessary<br /><br />   Yes, your pull request is *almost* git pull-request, but you seem<br />to have actively removed whitespace making it almost illegible. It's<br />really hard to pick out the line that has the actual git repository<br />address, because it's basically hidden inside one big blob of text.<br /><br />I've pulled this as-is since it's the first time, but I expect better next time.<br /><br />There are various resources on some cleanliness issues, and people<br />fairly recently tried to combine it under<br /><br />   Documentation/maintainer/rebasing-and-merging.rst<br /><br />which covers at least the basics on why not to rebase etc.<br /><br />And if you *do* end up rebasing, consider the end result "untested",<br />so then it should have been done before the merge window even started,<br />and the rebased branch should have been in linux-next. And not sent to<br />me the very next day.<br /><br />                   Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
