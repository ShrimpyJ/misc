So now I'm replying in separate threads<br />and I'm hoping the people involved have better threading than gmail<br />does ;/ ]<br /><br />On Mon, Jul 15, 2019 at 5:29 AM Jason Gunthorpe &lt;jgg&#64;mellanox.com&gt; wrote:<br />&gt;<br />&gt; The 'hmm' tree is something I ran to try and help workflow issues like<br />&gt; this, as it could be merged to DRM as a topic branch - maybe consider<br />&gt; this flow in future?<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Linus, do you have any advice on how best to handle sharing mm<br />&gt; patches?<br /><br />I don't have a lot of advice except for "very very carefully".<br /><br />I think the hmm tree worked really well this merge window, at least<br />from my standpoint.<br /><br />But it is of course possible that my happiness about the hmm tree is a<br />complete fluke and came about because pretty much all the patches were<br />removing oddities and cleaning things up, and they weren't adding new<br />odd things (or if they were, you hid it better ;^).<br /><br />Basically, people should know that there are some subsystems that I<br />end up being *much* more worried about than others. If I see a pull<br />request that modifies core VM of VFS code, I tend to go into "careful<br />mode", in ways that I don't do when some maintainer sends me a pull<br />request that obviously only changes some subtree that the maintainer<br />owns.<br /><br />When driver maintainers send me patches that touch their drivers, I<br />look at the diffstat.<br /><br />But when driver maintainers send me patches that change mm/, I look at<br />individual commit messages and the actual diff itself, and if I see<br />contentious stuff, I simply won't pull.<br /><br />It's why I left the hmm pull request (which came in early - thank you)<br />until yesterday, simply because just from the diffstat I could tell<br />that "ok, this merge isn't just me merging and doing sanity checks,<br />this is me having to set aside time to do reviews". So just from the<br />diffstat, I avoided even looking at it while I still had a mailbox<br />full of other pull requests.<br /><br />So I do like seeing core mm changes come in through a separate branch.<br />That's partly because that way it's easier to review without having<br />the parts I care about be mixed up with other parts (it's one reason I<br />asked the security layer pulls to be split up, to pick another area<br />entirely as an example). But it's also partly because if you have a<br />separate branch for the stuff that you know is contentious, that<br />doesn't then hold up the parts that _aren't_.<br /><br />For example, right now I'm not pulling _any_ of the drm updates,<br />simply because there's a part of it that I can't stomach.  It would<br />have been so much nicer if the contentious things that need a lot of<br />care separate, and I could have at least pulled the other stuff.<br /><br />                  Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
