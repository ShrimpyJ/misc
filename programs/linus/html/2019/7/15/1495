So even if the original reason for<br />the separate branch was to resolve some quilt/git integration issues,<br />I would not be at all surprised if just the extra indirection through<br />another person ended up making both the sending and receiving side<br />think more about each patch and think more about the abstraction.<br /><br />The hmm branch didn't actually seem to have any of the core VM people<br />reviewing it either, but it did have reviewers across companies for<br />all the patches, and I do think that that makes a difference.<br /><br />It's _soo_ easy for a patch series to be developed inside one company<br />by a couple of people who are probably in the same group, and have the<br />exact same objectives, to be a lot more biased (and likely biased not<br />towards the mm goals, but the goals of the code _outside_ the mm).<br /><br />This is just a long-winded way to say "I do think that the separate<br />and external branch with multiple interested parties" can have some<br />inherent advantages, when you actually have multiple people looking at<br />it with care and intent.<br /><br />(And here the fact that you have multiple subsystems looking at the<br />code is very much part of what makes it a good model - if it was just<br />an external branch for one single user - the vmware gfx driver - you<br />wouldn't get the same kind of advantages. So it's not the "external<br />branch" part itself, it's the "multiple users who care" part that<br />likely causes people to think more about the end result)<br /><br />Again - maybe I'm rationalizing, and the hmm branch just randomly<br />happened to work well this time. I do like having multiple people from<br />different groups look at things, though.<br /><br />                    Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
