The whole "we guarantee<br />&gt; &gt; entropy" model is broken.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; I agree here. Given that you suggested "to just fill the buffer and<br />&gt; return 0" in the previous mail (well, I think you really meant "return<br />&gt; buflen", otherwise ENOENTROPY == 0 and your previous objection applies),<br /><br />Right.<br /><br />The question remains when we should WARN_ON(), though.<br /><br />For example, if somebody did save entropy between boots, we probably<br />should accept that - at least in the sense of not warning when they<br />then ask for randomness data back.<br /><br />And if the hardware does have a functioning rdrand, we probably should<br />accept that too - simply because not accepting it and warning sounds a<br />bit too annoying.<br /><br />But we definitely *should* have a warning for people who build<br />embedded devices that we can't see any reasonable amount of possible<br />entropy. Those have definitely happened, and it's a serious and real<br />security issue.<br /><br />&gt; let's do just that. As a bonus, it saves applications from the complex<br />&gt; dance with retrying via /dev/urandom and finally brings a reliable API<br />&gt; (modulo old and broken kernels) to get random numbers (well, as random<br />&gt; as possible right now) without needing a file descriptor.<br /><br />Yeah, well, the question in the end always is "what is reliable".<br /><br />Waiting has definitely not been reliable, and has only ever caused problems.<br /><br />Returning an error (or some status while still doing a best effort)<br />would be reasonable, but I really do think that people will mis-use<br />that. We just have too much of a history of people having the mindset<br />that they can just fall back to something better - like waiting - and<br />they are always wrong.<br /><br />Just returning random data is the right thing, but we do need to make<br />sure that system developers see a warning if they do something<br />obviously wrong (so that the embedded people without even a real-time<br />clock to initialize any bits of entropy AT ALL won't think that they<br />can generate a system key on their router).<br /><br />               Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
