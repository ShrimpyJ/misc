In some setups (root on LUKS is one of<br />&gt; them) they happen early in the initramfs. Therefore "restoring" entropy<br />&gt; from the previous boot by a script that runs from the main system is too<br />&gt; late. That's why it is suggested to load at least a part of the random<br />&gt; seed in the boot loader, and that has not been commonly implemented.<br /><br />Honestly, I think the bootloader suggestion is naive and silly too.<br /><br />Yes, we now support it. And no, I don't think people will trust that<br />either. And I suspect for good reason: there's really very little<br />reason to believe that bootloaders would be any better than any other<br />part of the system.<br /><br />So right now some people trust bootloaders exactly _because_ there<br />basically is just one or two that do this, and the people who use them<br />are usually the people who wrote them or are at least closely<br />associated with them. That will change, and then people will say "why<br />would I trust that, when we know of bug Xyz".<br /><br />And I guarantee that those bugs _will_ happen, and people will quite<br />reasonably then say "yeah, I don't trust the bootloader". Bootloaders<br />do some questionable things.<br /><br />The most likely thing to actually be somewhat useful is I feel things<br />like the kernel just saving the seed by itself in nvram. There's<br />already an example of this for the EFI random seed thing, but that's<br />used purely for kexec, I think.<br /><br />Adding an EFI variable (or other platform nonvolatile thing), and<br />reading (and writing to it) purely from the kernel ends up being one<br />of those things where you can then say "ok, if we trust the platform<br />AT ALL, we can trust that". Since you can't reasonably do things like<br />add EFI variables to your distro image by mistake.<br /><br />Of course, even then people will say "I don't trust the platform". But<br />at some point you just say "you have trust issues" and move on.<br /><br />            Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
