This<br />&gt; replaces 3 macros of the same behavior (FIELD_SIZEOF(), SIZEOF_FIELD(),<br />&gt; and sizeof_field()). The last patch in the series has a script in the<br />&gt; commit log to do the conversion, if you want to compare the results<br />&gt; (they remained identical today when I checked).<br /><br />Honestly, I'm not sure why "sizeof_field()" wasn't just picked when we<br />already had it. Making a new macro for the exact same thing seems<br />somewhat questionable.<br /><br />Yes, yes, the C standard calls them "members". Except when it doesn't,<br />and they are members of a bit type, and it calls them bit-fields. And<br />'field' is a fairly common use outside of the standard - including<br />among compilers, but also in the kernel. Look at a lot of the tracing<br />code in the kernel, for example.,<br /><br />So we did have that existing macro, with a reasonable name, and it did<br />have some use, and it's not hard to understand.<br /><br />I also note that we don't actually use the word "member" much in the kernel:<br /><br />  $ git grep -iw member | wc<br />     3302   25603  280767<br />  $ git grep -iw field | wc<br />    26082  213732 2253806<br /><br />that's an almost order-of-magnitude vote in favor of "field" as a word, fwiw.<br /><br />HOWEVER.<br /><br />Another issue is that most of the patch is for the use by far is the<br />FIELD_SIZEOF macro.<br /><br />And the issue I have there is that while I think that could have a<br />better name - the upper-casing doesn't match offsetof or sizeof or any<br />of the existing struct/union member things - the _big_ user is<br />networking code.<br /><br />And I don't see anybody having actually talked to the networking<br />people whose code-base this mostly touches.<br /><br />Something like 80% of the patch is to that subsystem (and it would<br />have been even higher, if it wasn't for the forced "member" renaming),<br />I'd really like to see an Ack or similar.<br /><br />Maybe one was given during the discussions, but it's not visible in<br />the pull request or the git tree.<br /><br />So<br /><br /> (a) why didn't this use the already existing and well-named macro<br />that nobody really had issues with?<br /><br /> (b) I see no sign of the networking people having been asked about<br />their preferences.<br /><br />Hmm&gt;<br /><br />                  Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
