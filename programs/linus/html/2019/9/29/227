But at the same time the filenames it creates are very<br />annoying and clutter up the tree, and I'm not sure we really want that<br />in the first place.<br /><br />The thing _I_ would want is actually a lot less includes, and a lot<br />more streamlined, just for better build times. I sometimes get a small<br />pull, and wonder why the *whole* tree recompiles, and realize that<br />it's due to some really obscure header file that just gets included<br />"in case".<br /><br />So I'd like us to be stricter about header files another way entirely,<br />and I'm not sure that header files should need to be completely<br />independent.<br /><br />&gt; Of course, you can argue that it is addressing hypothetical issues<br />&gt; "what if the include directives are arranged in this order?",<br />&gt; that nobody has been hit before.<br /><br />Well, I think people hit it all the time but just add the right header<br />file when some build fails.<br /><br />In a perfect world, we'd have something that understands what symbols<br />get declared in each header file, and what symbols each header file<br />needs, and have a SAT solver for this that actually also understands<br />about different configurations and architectures. And actually<br />minimize the headers, and have a tool that warns when you have<br />unnecessary ones - or are lacking some.<br /><br />Yeah, it's probably too complex to be worth the pain, but it would be lovely.<br /><br />&gt; But, at least, I want to continue compile-testing<br />&gt; uapi headers that are exported to user-space.<br /><br />I think the uapi headers have a much stronger case for being<br />self-sufficient, but even there I'd really prefer some other model<br />than "*.h.s".<br /><br />We have the dot-files for dependencies and for tracking the command<br />that was used to generate them, I'd much rather have that. At least<br />then we wouldn't uglify the directory structure.<br /><br />Yea, I realize that some people "solve" that problem by just not<br />building in the source-tree at all, but I find that annoying too.<br /><br />               Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
