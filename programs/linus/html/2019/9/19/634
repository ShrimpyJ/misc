The problem is that there are fixes in<br />&gt; both trees: afs fixes go directly into yours whereas rxrpc fixes go via<br />&gt; networking and I would prefer to base my patches on both of them for testing<br />&gt; purposes.  What's the preferred method for dealing with that?  Base on a merge<br />&gt; of the lastest of those fixes in each tree?<br /><br />If you absolutely *have* to have something from another development<br />tree, that's generally a sign that something is screwed up with the<br />model in the first place, but when it happens,  you should make sure<br />that you have a stable point in that development tree.<br /><br />You might ask the upstream developer (ie Davem, in the case of the<br />network tree) what would be a good point, for example. Don't just pick<br />a random "tree of the day".<br /><br />The same very much goes for my tree, btw. You should simply never just<br />pick a random tree of the day as your base for work if you start with<br />my tree. That's true whether you do a merge or just start new<br />development on top of some point, or anything else, for that matter.<br /><br />Generally, you should never merge other peoples code without having<br />them _tell_ you that some particular point is a good thing to merge.<br />Releases are obviously implicitly such points, but generally<br />cross-tree merges need communication (a pull request to upstream is<br />the obvious such communication, but not necessarily the only one:<br />we've had cross-tree development that has involved separate branches<br />and just various synchronization emails between the two groups).<br /><br />Looking at rxrpc in particular - if that is what you were waiting for<br />- it looks more like you should just had an rxrpc branch, and asked<br />David to pull it for the 5.4 merge window. Then you could have used<br />that branch itself, as a starting point, perhaps. Or - better yet,<br />perhaps - merged it into your development tree based on a good AFS<br />starting point, with a *big* merge message explaining what you are<br />merging and why.<br /><br />Right now there is a merge with absolutely no explanation for why the<br />merge exists at all, and with some very non-obvious bases that really<br />look like they are just random points of development for both me and<br />for Davem.<br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
