If that'd be dropped then I am<br />&gt; pretty sure that the porting from /dev/urandom to getrandom() you see<br />&gt; in various projects (such as gdm/x11) would probably not take place.<br /><br />Sad. So people were actually are perfectly happy with urandom, but you<br />don't want the warning, so you use getrandom() and as a result your<br />boot blocks.<br /><br />What a sad sad reason for a bug.<br /><br />Btw, having a "I really don't care deeply about some long-term secure<br />key" flag would soilve that problem too. We'd happily and silently<br />give you data.<br /><br />The only reason we _do_ that silly printout for /dev/urandom is<br />exactly because /dev/random wasn't useful even for the people who<br />_really_ wanted secure randomness, so they started using /dev/urandom<br />despite the fact that it didn't necessarily have any entropy at all.<br /><br />So this all actually fundamentally goes back to the absolutely horrid<br />and entirely wrong semantics of /dev/random that made it entirely<br />useless for the only thing it was actually designed for.<br /><br />This is also an example of how hard-line "security" people that don't<br />see the shades of gray in between black and white are very much part<br />of the problem. If you have some unreasonable hard requirements,<br />you're going to do the wrong thing in the end.<br /><br />At some point even security people need to realize that reality isn't<br />black-and-white. It's not also keeping us from making any sane<br />progress, I feel, because of that bogus "entropy is sacred", despite<br />the fact that our entropy calculations are actually just random<br />made-up stuff (but "hey, reasonable") to begin with and aren't really<br />black-and-white themselves.<br /><br />&gt; In fact, speaking for systemd: the noisy logging in the kernel is the<br />&gt; primary (actually: only) reason that we prefer using RDRAND (if<br />&gt; available) over /dev/urandom if we need "medium quality" random<br />&gt; numbers, for example to seed hash tables and such. If the log message<br />&gt; wasn't there we wouldn't be tempted to bother with RDRAND and would<br />&gt; just use /dev/urandom like we used to for that.<br /><br />That's also very sad. If we have rdrand, we'll actually mix it into<br />/dev/urandom regardless, so it's again just the whole "people started<br />using urandom for keys because random was broken" that is the cause of<br />this all.<br /><br />I really really detest the whole inflexible "security" mindset.<br /><br />&gt; We can make boot hang in "sane", discoverable way.<br /><br />That is certainly a huge advantage, yes. Right now I suspect that what<br />has happened is that this has probably been going on as some low-level<br />background noise for a while, and people either figured it out and<br />switched away from gdm (example: Christoph), or more likely some<br />unexplained boot problems that people just didn't chase down. So it<br />took basically a random happenstance to make this a kernel issue.<br /><br />But "easily discoverable" would be good.<br /><br />&gt; The reason why I think this should also be logged by the kernel since<br />&gt; people use netconsole and pstore and whatnot and they should see this<br />&gt; there. If systemd with its infrastructure brings this to screen via<br />&gt; plymouth then this wouldn't help people who debug much more low-level.<br /><br />Well, I certainly agree with a kernel message (including a big<br />WARN_ON_ONCE), but you also point out that the last time we added<br />helpful messages to let people know, it had some seriously unintended<br />consequences ;)<br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
