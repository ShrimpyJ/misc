Lots of<br />possible low-level jitter there to use for entropy. But especially if<br />you're just idly _waiting_ for entropy, you won't be "CPU-bound on an<br />interesting load" - you'll just hit the CPU idle loop all the time so<br />even that wouldn't work.<br /><br />But practically speaking timers really are not really much of an<br />option. And if we are idle, even having a high-frequency TSC isn't all<br />that useful with the timer interrupt, because the two tend to be very<br />intimately related.<br /><br />Of course, if you're generating a host key for SSH or something like<br />that, you could try to at least cause some network traffic while<br />generating the key. That's not much of an option for the _kernel_, but<br />for a program like ssh-keygen it certainly could be.<br /><br />Blocking is fine if you simply don't care about time at all (the "five<br />hours later is fine" situation), or if you have some a-priori<br />knowledge that the machine is doing real interesting work that will<br />generate entropy. But I don't see how the kernel can generate entropy<br />on its own, particularly during boot (which is when the problem<br />happens), when most devices aren't even necessarily meaningfully set<br />up yet.<br /><br />Hopefully hw random number generators will make this issue effectively<br />moot before we really end up having the "nvdimms and their ilk are<br />common enough that you really have no early boot irq-driven disk IO at<br />all".<br /><br />           Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
