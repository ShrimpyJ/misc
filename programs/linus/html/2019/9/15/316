It's called "/dev/random". And<br />guess what? Not blocking wasn't what lead to weak keys like you try to<br />imply.<br /><br />What led to weak keys is that /dev/random is useless and nobody sane<br />uses it, exactly because it always blocks.<br /><br />So you claim that it is lack of blocking that is the problem, but<br />you're ignoring reality. You are ignoring the very real fact that<br />blocking is what led to people not using the blocking interface in the<br />first place, because IT IS THE WRONG MODEL.<br /><br />It really is fundamentally wrong. Blocking by definition will never<br />work, because it doesn't add any entropy. So people then don't use the<br />blocking interface, because it doesn't _work_.<br /><br />End result: they then use another interface that does work, but isn't secure.<br /><br />I have told you that in this thread, and HISTORY should have told you<br />that. You're not listening.<br /><br />If you want secure keys, you can't rely on a blocking model, because<br />it ends up not working. Blocking leads to problems.<br /><br />If you want secure keys, you should do the exact opposite of blocking:<br />you should encourage people to explicitly use a non-blocking "I want<br />secure random numbers", and then if that fails, they should do things<br />that cause entropy.<br /><br />So getrandom() just repeated a known broken model. And you're<br />parroting that same old known broken stuff. It didn't work with<br />/dev/random, why do you think it magically works with getrandom()?<br /><br />Stop fighting reality.<br /><br />The fact is, either you have sufficient entropy or you don't.<br /><br /> - if you have sufficient entropy, blocking is stupid and pointless<br /><br /> - if you don't have sufficient entropy, blocking is exactly the wrong<br />thing to do.<br /><br />Seriously. Don't make excuses for bad interfaces. We should have<br />learnt this long ago.<br /><br />             Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
