I guess I'm most surprised by<br />&gt; the discrepancy between the shortlog and the diffstat, whereas I intuitively<br />&gt; expected them to be generated in the same way.<br /><br />So logs and diffs are fundamentally different.<br /><br />A log is an operation on a _set_ of commits (that's the whole point -<br />you don't list the beginning and the end, you list all the commits in<br />between), while a diff is fundamentally an operation on two end-points<br />and shows the code difference between those two points.<br /><br />And the summary versions of those operations (shortlog and diffstat)<br />are no different.<br /><br />So as a set operation, "shortlog" has no issues with multiple merge<br />bases. Doing a shortlog is still just a set difference between your<br />commits and the upstream commits, and the number of merge bases is<br />irrelevant. "List all commits that I have, but upstream doesn't have"<br />is a very straightforward and natural set operation.<br /><br />But as a "two endpoints" operation, diffstat has real problems any<br />time you have more than two endpoints - when you have multiple merge<br />bases, you fundamentally have more than two endpoints: you have all of<br />the merge bases, and then you have your end result.<br /><br />What you doing the merge does is to turn the multiple merge bases into<br />just one point: the thing you merged against now becomes the common<br />merge point, and now you have a "two endpoints" for the diffstat: the<br />thing you merged against, and your end result are now the two points<br />that you can diff against.<br /><br />But the shortlog is always correct, because it just doesn't even care<br />about that whole issue.<br /><br />                Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
