If I see a diffstat that doesn't match, I just look at what a<br />non-merged diffstat would have looked like, and if that matches I know<br />what happened.<br /><br />There are other reasons why diffstats won't match, of course. Like me<br />just having merged part of the same commits from another source (or<br />multiple trees applying the same patch). So it's not _just_ due to<br />multiple merge bases that the mis-match can happen.<br /><br />&gt; Most of the time I notice it like Will did because the diffstat is<br />&gt; obviously weird and it's good to check pull requests a second (and a<br />&gt; third :-) time as well, but it's possible to have relatively small<br />&gt; distances between the merge bases where the diffstat doesn't look<br />&gt; 'obviously' bogus and mistakes can slip through.<br /><br />Yup.<br /><br />&gt; Anyway, a small Git feature request: it would be super useful if "git<br />&gt; request-pull" output was a bit more dependable and at least warned about<br />&gt; this and didn't include what is, from the viewpoint of the person doing<br />&gt; the merge, a bogus diffstat.<br /><br />Well, warning for it would be fairly simple. Giving the "right" result<br />isn't simple, though, since the merge might need manual fixup to<br />succeed.<br /><br />The warning you can check yourself: just do<br /><br />    git merge-base --all upstream mybranch<br /><br />and if you get more than one result, you know you are in the situation<br />where a diff from the merge base might not work (it *might* work, but<br />probably won't).<br /><br />You can play around with it yourself, of course. Look at the<br />git-request-puill.sh script, it says something like this:<br /><br />  merge_base=$(git merge-base $baserev $headrev) ||<br />  die "fatal: No commits in common between $base and $head"<br /><br />and you could add something like<br /><br />  all_merge_bases="$(git merge-base --all $baserev $headrev)"<br /><br />and then add a warning if "all_merge_bases" doesn't match "merge_base".<br /><br />                Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
