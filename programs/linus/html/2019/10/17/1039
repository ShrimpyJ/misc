In the end<br />&gt; I had to emulate the pull locally because I couldn't figure out how to<br />&gt; drive request-pull correctly despite the shortlog being correct. I'd love<br />&gt; to know what I should've done instead.<br /><br />You did the right thing.<br /><br />When there are multiple merge bases, a regular "git diff" doesn't work<br />since it's fundamentally about two end-points (well, it _can_ work<br />almost by mistake, but doesn't work in the general case). So the only<br />way to get a "proper" diff is to do a merge and then diff the result.<br /><br />That said, I also accept the output of "git diff" which will then have<br />a lot of noise from all the _other_ work done between the two merge<br />bases. I can figure out what happened, and do my own two-endpoint diff<br />and see what happened, and still se that "yes, that's what the pull<br />request meant, and that's why the diffstat is garbage".<br /><br />What you did is the "good quality" pull request, though.<br /><br />In general, people who aren't doing fancy things with git should never<br />get to the "multiple merge bases" situation, and then the regular pull<br />request logic works fine.<br /><br />And people likme you who are doing multiple branches and know what<br />they are doing are also able to them handle the "uhhuh, I need to do a<br />merge to get a good diffstat" situation.<br /><br />            Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
