You're magically ok<br />with using stale data from the cache just because it's cached, even if<br />another client might have truncated the file or something.<br /><br />So you're ok with saying "the file used to be X bytes in size, so<br />we'll just give you this data because we trust that the X is correct".<br /><br />But you're not ok to say "oh, the file used to be X bytes in size, but<br />we don't want to give you a short read because it might not be correct<br />any more".<br /><br />See the disconnect? You trust the size in one situation, but not in another one.<br /><br />I also don't really see that you *need* the new flag at all. Since<br />you're doing to do a speculative read and then a real read anyway, and<br />since the only thing that you seem to care about is the file size<br />(because the *data* you will trust if it is cached), then why don't<br />you just use the *existing* generic read, and *IFF* you get a<br />truncated return value, then you go and double-check that the file<br />hasn't changed in size?<br /><br />See what I'm saying? I think gfs2 is being very inconsistent in when<br />it trusts the file size, and I don't see that you even need the new<br />behavior that patch gives, because you might as well just use the<br />existing code (just move the i_size check earlier, and then teach gfs2<br />to double-check the "I didn't get as much as I expected" case).<br /><br />                 Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
