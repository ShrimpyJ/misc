I doubt it, but hey, I'm not stopping you.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; For anyone taking you up on this I'd like to suggest two possible<br />&gt; directions.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; 1) Increasing PAGE_SIZE in the kernel.<br /><br />Yes. This is something I actually want to do anyway for 2.7.x. Dan <br />Phillips had some patches for this six months ago.<br /><br />You have to be careful, since you have to be able to mmap "partial pages", <br />which is what makes it less than trivial, but there are tons of reasons to <br />want to do this, and cache coloring is actually very much a secondary <br />concern.<br /><br />&gt; 2) Creating zones for the different colors.  Zones were not<br />&gt;    implemented last time, this was tried.<br /><br />Hey, I can tell you that you _will_ fail.<br /><br />Zones are actually a wonderful example of the kinds of problems you get<br />into when you have pages of different types aka "colors". We've had<br />nothing but trouble trying to balance different zones against each other,<br />and those problems were in fact _the_ reason for 99% of all the VM<br />problems in 2.4.x.<br /><br />Trying to use them for cache colors would be "interesting". <br /><br />Not to mention that it's impossible to coalesce pages across zones.<br /><br />&gt; Both of those should be minimal impact to the complexity<br />&gt; of the current kernel. <br /><br />Minimal? I don't think so. Zones are basically impossible, and page size <br />changes will hopefully happen during 2.7.x, but not due to page coloring.<br /><br />&gt; I don't know where we will wind up but the performance variation's<br />&gt; caused by cache conflicts in today's applications are real, and easily<br />&gt; measurable.  Giving the growing increase in performance difference<br />&gt; between CPUs and memory Amdahl's Law shows this will only grow<br />&gt; so I think this is worth looking at.<br /><br />Absolutely wrong.<br /><br />Why? Because the fact is, that as memory gets further and further away <br />from CPU's, caches have gotten further and further away from being direct <br />mapped. <br /><br />Cache coloring is already a very questionable win for four-way <br />set-associative caches. I doubt you can even _see_ it for eight-way or <br />higher associativity caches.<br /><br />In other words: the pressures you mention clearly do exist, but they are <br />all driving direct-mapped caches out of the market, and thus making page<br />coloring _less_ interesting rather than more.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
