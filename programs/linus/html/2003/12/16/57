Ideal to the point of being<br />unrealistic.<br /><br />In most real-world situations, latency is at least as important as<br />throughput, and often dominates the story. At which point RAID-0 doesn't<br />improve performance one iota (it might make the seeks shorter, but since<br />seek latency tends to be dominated by things like rotational delay and<br />settle times, that's unlikely to be a really noticeable issue).<br /><br />Latency is noticeable even on what appears to be "prue throughput" tests,<br />because not only do you seldom get perfect overlap (RAID-0 also increases<br />your required IO window size by a factor of N to get the N-time<br />improvement), but even "pure throughput" benchmarks often have small<br />serialized sections, and Amdahls law bites you in the ass _really_<br />quickly.<br /><br />In fact, Amdahls law should be revered a hell of a lot more than Moore's<br />law. One is a conjecture, the other one is simple math.<br /><br />Anyway, the serialized sections can be CPU or bus (quite common at the<br />point where a single disk can stream 50MB/s when accessed linearly), or it<br />can be things like fetching meta-data (ie indirect blocks).<br /><br />&gt; Wether the current drivers manages that is of course another story.<br /><br />No. Please don't confuse limitations of RAID0 with limitations of "the<br />current drivers".<br /><br />Yes, the drivers are a part of the picture, but they are a _small_ part of<br />a very fundamental issue.<br /><br />The fact is, modern disks are GOOD at streaming data. They're _really_<br />good at it compared to just about anything else they ever do. The win you<br />get from even medium-sized stripes on RAID0 are likely to not be all that<br />noticeable, and you can definitely lose _big_ just because it tends to<br />hack your IO patterns to pieces.<br /><br />My personal guess is that modern RAID0 stripes should be on the order of<br />several MEGABYTES in size rather than the few hundred kB that most people<br />use (not to mention the people who have 32kB stripes or smaller - they<br />just kill their IO access patterns with that, and put the CPU at<br />ridiculous strain).<br /><br />Big stripes help because:<br /><br /> - disks already do big transfers well, so you shouldn't split them up.<br />   Quite frankly, the kinds of access patterns that let you stream<br />   multiple streams of 50MB/s and get N-way throughput increases just<br />   don't exists in the real world outside of some very special niches (DoD<br />   satellite data backup, or whatever).<br /><br /> - it makes it more likely that the disks in the array really have<br />   _independent_ IO patterns, ie if you access multiple files the disks<br />   may not seek around together, but instead one disk accesses one file.<br />   At this point RAID0 starts to potentially help _latency_, simply<br />   because by now it may help avoid physical seeking rather than just try<br />   to make throughput go up.<br /><br />I may be wrong, of course.
