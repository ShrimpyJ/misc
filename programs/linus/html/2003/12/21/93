First, as Linus<br />&gt; has stated recently (and as has been the policy for a while), the<br />&gt; kernel should avoid having any patented code<br /><br />That's not true.<br /><br />The kernel should have no patented code THAT DOESN'T HAVE A LICENSE.<br /><br />There are several cases where this came up: RCU is one obvious one, but <br />there were also issues with Intel's initial submissions of some of the <br />networking drivers where they didn't want to originally release under the <br />GPL because of worrying about patents they owned.<br /><br />The email you quote expressly says "unless you can get the patent holder <br />to grant a license". And the RTLinux patents were licensed to GPL'd <br />projects. See the RTLinux "open patent license".<br /><br />I don't understand why people continually complain about the RTLinux<br />patents. I bet it's because Victor has all the easy charm of Larry McVoy,<br />but I don't see why people still continue to spread obvious<br />mis-information about the situation.<br /><br />It's doubly discgusting with some of the people who were trying to spread <br />all the FUD and mis-information were doing so because they were themselves <br />doing a non-GPL microkernel, and they complained about how the patents <br />were somehow against the GPL and wanted to get community support by trying <br />to make out the situation to be somehow different from what it was.<br /><br />I'm not a supporter of software patents, but while I dislike them, I don't <br />dislike them _nearly_ as much as I dislike dishonest people.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
