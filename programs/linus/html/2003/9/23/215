And to me, distributed<br />development is the only thing that matters.<br /><br />And I realise it isn't to you. You don't much care about merging, you only<br />have your tree you need to worry about. <br /><br />And you know what? You shouldn't have to care. I'm not berating you for<br />using CVS/SVN/whatever. I'm berating you for complaining when _others_<br />have come to the conclusion that CVS/SVN/whatever really doesn't cut it<br />for them.<br /><br />Use CVS and be happy. But don't complain to others that have needs that <br />CVS simply can't fill. <br /><br />  [ Bad analogy time ]<br /><br />You're acting like a husband that has a wife that refuses to use make-up,<br />and thinks that everybody else should have ugly wives too, and calls them <br />whores for being prettier.<br /><br />Actually, in the CVS analogy, I don't think it's that your wife refuses to<br />use make-up, but that make-up doesn't actually help.<br /><br />  [ Ok, let's see just _how_ badly I get flamed for that analogy. I<br />    admit, it really sucks, and is tasteless to boot. My bad. ]<br /><br />&gt; But note that cvs+cvsps is already perfectly usable for me, most people<br />&gt; is readonly anyways<br /><br />Indeed. That's pretty much all non-distributed stuff is useful for, from<br />where I'm stading.  Small projects with a few developers and a lot of<br />read-only stuff. And even there the developers will bitch about the<br />limitations.<br /><br />Sure, SVN makes branches cheaper, but you still have to work with them<br />like under CVS, ie merging is a total disaster. And you still can't make <br />it your private repository.<br /><br />But that wasn't really my point. My point is that you're only starting<br />flame wars, with no actual point to your emails. Please don't.<br /><br />	"Those that can, do. Those that can't, complain".<br /><br />You're complaining, right now. Everybody who has ever used BK admits to <br />its techical superiority. That's just a fact.<br /><br />I don't care about source control software, so I'm not likely to start<br />coding one any time soon (like "ever") - but if I did, I'd be totally<br />_ashamed_ to push lower-quality stuff on users. I'd make excuses for it,<br />and I'd 'fess up when they didn't work. And I'd try my best to make it<br />better. Even if it took me a decade.<br /><br />In contrast, what you're doing is saying "ignore the good stuff: use this<br />crap, because I'm buddies with the people developing it. We aren't even<br />trying to compete on technical terms, but we'll push our version on you<br />because we've got religion, and this doesn't contain any cow-meat". That's<br />bad - especially if others DON'T share the religion.<br /><br />I'm ok with other people using NT. When it's better for them, that's their<br />choice. I work hard to make sure that the Linux kernel is technically<br />superior, and if I feel it isn't I want to fix it. Because I do _not_ want<br />people using Linux for religious reasons. I want people to use Linux<br />because it is _better_ for them, of because they truly believe that they<br />can make it so (or at least have fun trying).<br /><br />Take pride in what you do. But don't make that pride blind you to what is <br />good technology, and what isn't. Don't get religion. It's a science.<br /><br />Oh well. I told you not to start a flamewar, and I told Larry to not raise <br />to the bait. Now I'll just take my own advice and stop responding. You too <br />please stop baiting,<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
