Not for political reasons, just good tech.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Unfortunately the segmentation and paging were so poorly integrated in<br />&gt; i386 that rings 1-2 are pretty much totally useless.<br /><br />That may be the politically sensitive (except to Intel) correct answer, <br />but in the end I suspect that the _real_ answer is that ring 1/2 are just <br />fundamentally useless, and it has nothing to do with x86 implementation <br />semantics or anything else.<br /><br />Any kind of reasonable performance driver requires direct access to the<br />buffers it is going to fill in. And not just the actual data contents, but<br />to the metadata too - the pointers that comprise the skb (or in BSD, mbuf)  <br />lists, etc.<br /><br />So even if you were to use ring1/2 for the driver, you'd really need to<br />give write access to a large portion of the data structures that the<br />"core" kernel networking would use.<br /><br />Which means that you either put the core kernel in ring1/2 as well (at<br />which point you don't actually use ring0 for anything interesting at all -<br />you could put a microkernel there, but hey, there's no real point), or you<br />map in a _lot_ of ring0 metadata into ring1/2, at which point you lost the<br />whole point of using a different protection domain.<br /><br />And quite frankly, if you're willing to actually dynamically map all the<br />ranges and be careful, why use ring1/2 at all? You might as well use ring3<br />and make the whole thing be a user-mode wrapper. You'd never perform<br />really well, but for debugging it is acceptable.<br /><br />Anyway, whatever way you turn, ring1/2 just don't actually _give_ you <br />anything. Which is, in the end, the _real_ reason nobody uses them.<br /><br />(I agree, the fact that the x86 paging hardware makes 1/2/3 be equivalent <br />makes it an even _less_ useful abstraction, but I think it is a mistake to <br />think that it would be any more useful even if the page tables wasted <br />precious bits on unnecessary level information).<br /><br />Multi-ring was a failure. Let it go. The only reason it is making<br />something of a comeback (Palladium-whatever-it-is-called-today) has no<br />good technical reasons, and is purely about other things.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
