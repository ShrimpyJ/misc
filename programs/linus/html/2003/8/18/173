However, there is the opposite point of view which is equally<br />&gt; valid.  There aren't many people with the hardware, and the people<br />&gt; that there are aren't interested in development kernel series, so<br />&gt; even if we did convert them during 2.7, we wouldn't hear about it<br />&gt; until 2.8.<br /><br />Yes. However, what worries me more is that there are people who have the <br />hardware, but because the driver won't even compile for them, they just go <br />"oh, well, I'll try it again when the _real_ 2.6.0 hits the streets".<br /><br />Which obviously won't work.<br /><br />So I'm trying to make sure that all the broken drivers are gotten to a <br />working state. Right now, considering how long they've been broken, that <br />means "it must compile" so that people can test them. <br /><br />The "leave it broken, so that somebody will fix it properly some day" <br />approach is a fine one for early development series. But right now I'd <br />prefer to see patches to make drivers compile cleanly, even if people <br />can't test them on real hardware.<br /><br />The intersection of people who have the hardware, and people who have the <br />time/knowledge to convert a driver, may be empty. Expecially for odd <br />hardware. So let's get those drivers compiling, even if we can't test <br />them, so that others _can_ test them.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
