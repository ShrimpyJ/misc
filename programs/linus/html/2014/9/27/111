I think the patch itself was<br />too ugly to live.<br /><br />Yes, we had that hack before, but we didn't make it conditional. It<br />historically was more of a "it's easier to just memcpy the name" than<br />switch things around. Then that became accidental semantics, and<br />that's all normal. But then when we make this explicit and<br />intentional, I really think we should do it *right*, and either<br />switch() the names around or just copy it.<br /><br />Having a "switch_names()" function that *neither* switches *nor*<br />copies, and giving it an argument to decide which, but not even do it<br />*right*? That's just too f*cking disgusting for words.<br /><br />So seriously, I think we should:<br /><br /> - keep the "switch_names()" as is, since it actually does what the<br />name says it does, and some callers want to statically do exactly<br />that.<br /><br /> - make a new "move_name(src,dst)" that explicitly moves names, and<br />explicitly knows that the source needs to be kept alive (although it<br />*could* also look at the source dentry refcount to decide whether it<br />needs to be careful or not). And do it right for the long names too,<br />not just the inline case.<br /><br /> - make that __d_move() caller just pick one or the other explicitly.<br /><br />See what my complaint is? Not this half-assery that used to be a small<br />random detail, and that the patch makes into an institutionalized and<br />explicit half-assery.<br /><br />(And Mikhail - I'm not ragging on you, even if I'm ragging on the<br />patch. I understand why you did it the way you did, and it makes sense<br />exactly in the "let's reinstate old hackery" model. I just think we<br />can and should do better than that, now that the "exchange" vs "move<br />over" semantics are so explicit).<br /><br />Al (or Mikhail) - willing to do that extra cleanup? Please?<br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
