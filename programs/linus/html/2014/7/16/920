For example, if I send a pull request to John<br />&gt; which I know will issue a conflict it would be nice to include<br />&gt; instructions (or some sort of patch) how I think it should be resolved.<br /><br />So from personal experience seeing lots of different explanations, my<br />preferred one is not so much a patch, as explaining *why* something<br />generates a merge conflict.<br /><br />Optimally for each conflict, say what happened ("X changed Y, A<br />changed B close by") and then describe the result in those terms (eg<br />"pick the code from my branch, but then do the rename of xyz to abc<br />that caused the conflict", or "pick your side, it obsoletes the fix<br />from me that causes the conflict" or whatever).<br /><br />And if you have a *lot* of conflicts, explain why that happaned too,<br />and think very hard about whether what you do is perhaps screwed up<br />(or complain about the other entity that did annoying whitespace<br />changes for no good reason or whatever). Maybe it's just that the<br />source code is badly organized, but more likely it's because somebody<br />is just doing something stupid, and people are stepping on each others<br />toes. If the explanation is "this is a one-time issue brought on by<br />xyz", then that's fine - sh*t happens. If it's something else, at<br />least mention it. And if it keeps happening, something needs to be<br />done.<br /><br />And in the end, I personally tend to always resolve the conflicts<br />*without* really looking at the explanation, by just trying to figure<br />it out on my own. I've had people send me incorrect resolution<br />suggestions, and I've also occasionally just screwed up my own<br />resolution. Having somebody elses explanations of what they did is a<br />good sanity check that things went right (when their explanation<br />matches mine), and is a good red flag about "maybe this is more<br />complicated than I thought" when the explanations and results don't<br />match up.<br /><br />                     Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
