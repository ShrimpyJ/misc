Not only does it apparently stay up for you now, the traces seem<br />to be improving in quality.<br /><br />There's a decided pattern of "copy_page_range()" and "zap_page_range()" here.<br /><br />Now, what's *also* intriguing is how many "_raw_spin_lock_nested"<br />things there are in there. Which makes me suspect that you are<br />actually hitting some really nasty spinlock contention, and that your<br />22s lockups could be due to lock hold times going exponential.<br /><br />So I don't think that it's the copy_page_range() itself that is<br />necessarily all that horribly expensive (although it's certainly not a<br />lightweight function), but the fact that you get contention on some<br />lock inside that loop, and when you have every single CPU hammering on<br />it things just go to hell in a handbasket.<br /><br />And when spinlocks start getting  contention, *nested* spinlocks<br />really really hurt. And you've got all the spinlock debugging on etc,<br />don't you? Which just makes the locks really expensive, and much much<br />easier to start becoming contended (and there's *another* level of<br />nesting, because I think the lockdep stuff has its own locking<br />inside). So you have three levels of spinlock nesting, and the outer<br />one will be completely hammered.<br /><br />So I think the locks you have are from copy_pte_range:<br /><br />        dst_pte = pte_alloc_map_lock(dst_mm, dst_pmd, addr, &amp;dst_ptl);<br />        if (!dst_pte)<br />                return -ENOMEM;<br />        src_pte = pte_offset_map(src_pmd, addr);<br />        src_ptl = pte_lockptr(src_mm, src_pmd);<br />        spin_lock_nested(src_ptl, SINGLE_DEPTH_NESTING);<br /><br />and we do have some mitigation in place for horrible horrible<br />contention (try to release every few entries, but with all CPU's<br />hammering on these locks, and things being slow due to all the<br />debugging, I think we may finally be hitting the right place here.<br /><br />Also, you do have this:<br /><br />  sched: RT throttling activated<br /><br />so there's something going on with RT scheduling too. I'd consider all<br />the softlockups after that point suspect - the softlockup thread has<br />presumably used so much CPU spewing out the debug messages that things<br />aren't really working any more RT-wise.<br /><br />Lookie here (the "soft lockup" grep is to skip all the cross-CPU<br />traces from other CPU's that weren't necessarily the problem case):<br /><br />  [torvalds&#64;i7 linux]$ grep -5 "soft lockup" ~/0.txt | grep RIP<br />   RIP: 0010:   lock_acquire+0xb4/0x120<br />   RIP: 0010:   lock_acquire+0xb4/0x120<br />   RIP: 0010:   generic_exec_single+0xee/0x1b0<br />   RIP: 0010:   lock_acquire+0xb4/0x120<br />   RIP: 0010:   lock_acquire+0xb4/0x120<br />   RIP: 0010:   lock_acquire+0xb4/0x120<br />   RIP: 0010:   lock_acquire+0xb4/0x120<br />   RIP: 0010:   lock_acquire+0xb4/0x120<br />   RIP: 0010:   lock_acquire+0xb4/0x120<br />   RIP: 0010:   shmem_write_end+0x65/0xf0<br />   RIP: 0010:   _raw_spin_unlock_irqrestore+0x38/0x60<br />   RIP: 0010:   copy_user_enhanced_fast_string+0x5/0x10<br />   RIP: 0010:   copy_user_enhanced_fast_string+0x5/0x10<br />   RIP: 0010:   __slab_alloc+0x52f/0x58f<br />   RIP: 0010:   map_id_up+0x9/0x80<br />   RIP: 0010:   cpuidle_enter_state+0x79/0x190<br />   RIP: 0010:   unmap_single_vma+0x7d9/0x900<br />   RIP: 0010:   cpuidle_enter_state+0x79/0x190<br /><br />and notice the pattern? All those early RIP cases are the page table<br />locks for copy_page_range and that one TLB flush for zap_page_range..<br /><br />So your printouts are finally starting to make sense. But I'm also<br />starting to suspect strongly that the problem is that with all your<br />lock debugging and other overheads (does this still have<br />DEBUG_PAGEALLOC?) you really are getting into a "real" softlockup<br />because things are scaling so horribly badly.<br /><br />If you now disable spinlock debugging and lockdep, hopefully that page<br />table lock now doesn't always get hung up on the lockdep locking, so<br />it starts scaling much better, and maybe you'd not see this...<br /><br />                    Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
