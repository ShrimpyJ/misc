Why is it in<br />that header file?<br /><br />Then there's "ftrace_caller_setup", which uses MCOUNT_SAVE_FRAME, and<br />sets up %rsi/rdi to have the parent/rip stuff.<br /><br />And that one does a particularly bad job *too*, since it's used in<br />only two of the four places that want this, with the other two doing<br />the whole thing by hand (look for things like<br /><br />        movq RIP(%rsp), %rsi<br />        subq $MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE, %rsi<br /><br />being duplicated..)<br /><br />And it's also being particularly stupid about this all, because of the<br />horrible MCOUNT_SAVE_FRAME placement somewhere else. That<br />MCOUNT_SAVE_FRAME macro actually loads that %rip value into %rdx, but<br />because of the extra indirection and odd extra macro in a header file<br />(even though that one *.S file is the only apparent user),<br />"ftrace_caller_setup" doesn't actually realize that, and instead just<br />reloads it from where the previous macro just saved it. So the code it<br />generates just looks bad too.<br /><br />And now your patch adds a *third* macro, to make up for the fact that<br />the first macro did a bad job.<br /><br />You already have too many of these macros, and they are already ugly.<br />Why not just *fix* the existing macro, instead of adding yet another<br />layer of confusion and horror?<br /><br />&gt; If you want, I can add more comments to explain all this.<br /><br />I'd really prefer the underlying problem to be fixed, not more<br />explanations for odd code choices.<br /><br />Why can't MCOUNT_SAVE_FRAME just save the frame right? Maybe even do<br />it unconditionally - the cost of setting up a frame is not that huge,<br />and it might be better to have more understandable code and avoid yet<br />another ifdef for a config option.<br /><br />And while at it, why not move it to where it's used, and maybe make it<br />not scream?<br /><br />And maybe "ftrace_caller_setup" could be fixed so that the two cases<br />that now do that magic MCOUNT_INSN_SIZE stuff could use it?<br /><br />Looking at that file, I just get the heebie-jeebies. It's like a<br />Halloween house of horrors of macros and #ifdefs. I'd really prefer<br />for a fix to not just be band-aid that makes it even worse.<br /><br />                   Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
