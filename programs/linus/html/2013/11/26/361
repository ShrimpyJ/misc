Possibly brought<br />on by being low on memory due to a memory leak.<br /><br />I'm not seeing any suspicious locks: the sshd that holds the mmap_sem<br />locks for a fork() seems to be in congestion-wait for the disk due to<br />trying to allocate memory, exactly like all the trinity children are.<br /><br />You don't have memory information in your dump, but to me it looks<br />like you're basically out of memory (there's a *lot* of<br />trinity-children trying to allocate pages), and the oom killer isn't<br />triggering for whatever reason.<br /><br />Of course, it could easily be a kernel memory leak too (rather than<br />trinity), triggered by your odd workload.<br /><br />                 Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
