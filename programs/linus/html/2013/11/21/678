I would really have preferred seeing the key subsystem<br />changes in a separate branch, to make it easier for me to do the<br />"normal updates" first, and then do just the big changes separately.<br />The key subsystem changes had absolutely _nothing_ in common with the<br />rest of the security subsystem changes afaik.<br /><br />The fact that they got mixed up also made it all messier to go<br />through, since there were (two sets of) fixes after the internal<br />merges of the other security stuff - if the key subsystem changes had<br />been a branch of its own, the fixes would have remained on that branch<br />too.<br /><br />So for future cases: if there are big independent overhauls of core<br />subsystems, I'd really like to see them kept separate, ok?<br /><br />Also, David, with (for example) 1700+ new lines in lib/assoc_array.c,<br />I would really *really* like code like this to have some review by<br />outsiders. Maybe you did have that, but I saw absolutely no sign of it<br />in the tree when I merged it. That code alone made me go "Hmm, where<br />did this come from, how was it tested, why should I merge it?".<br /><br />I do see *some* minimal comments on it from George Spelvin on lkml. I<br />don't see any sign of that in the commit messages, though. I'd also<br />see no comments on where the algorithm came from etc. It clearly has<br />subtle memory ordering (smp_read_barrier_depends() etc), so I'm<br />assuming it is based on something else or at least has some history to<br />it. What is that history?<br /><br />In short: this is exactly the kind of thing I *don't* enjoy merging,<br />because the code that needed review was<br /><br /> - mixed up with other changes that had nothing to do with it<br /> - had no pointers to help me review it<br /> - had zero information about others who had possibly reviewed it before<br /><br />and quite frankly, without the extended explanation of what the<br />changes were for (which I also didn't get initially), I'd probably<br />have decided half-way that it's not worth the headache.<br /><br />In the end, the code didn't look bad, and I didn't find any obvious<br />problems, but there's very much a reason why I merged this over two<br />weeks after the first pull request was originally sent to me.<br /><br />So guys, make it easier for me to merge these kinds of things, and<br />*don't* do what happened this time. Ok? Pretty please?<br /><br />                  Linus<br /><br />On Tue, Nov 19, 2013 at 4:20 AM, James Morris &lt;jmorris&#64;namei.org&gt; wrote:<br />&gt; Also, here's an updated branch to pull from with four new fixes from<br />&gt; David.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; ---<br />&gt;<br />&gt; The following changes since commit be408cd3e1fef73e9408b196a79b9934697fe3b1:<br />&gt;<br />&gt;   Merge git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/davem/net (2013-11-04 06:40:55 -0800)<br />&gt;<br />&gt; are available in the git repository at:<br />&gt;<br />&gt;   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/jmorris/linux-security.git for-linus2<br />...<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
