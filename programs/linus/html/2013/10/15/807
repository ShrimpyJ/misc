You'll notice that I<br />&gt; have a shiny-new gpg key which is currently only signed by my old key.<br />&gt; Yes. Bad. I left it very late to create a new key, the old key is now<br />&gt; expired, and I haven't gotten anyone else to sign the new one yet. It<br />&gt; will be properly signed real-soon-now and I can resend the pull<br />&gt; request when that happens if you don't like this one.<br /><br />Hmm. Why did you do a 2048-bit key? Your old one was 4k..<br /><br />Since you haven't gotten anybody to sign the new key yet, may I<br />suggest throwing this one away and doing a new 4096-bit key?<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, I know, my *own* key is just 2048 bits, because back when<br />I created it we were discussing using various hardware tokens, and<br />some of them (at the time) didn't do more than 2k. So I shouldn't<br />really complain when somebody else does a 2k key. But that was a few<br />years ago, and I claim stupidity (I never did use a hardware token).<br /><br />Anyway, pulled, since it was all signed by your previous key, and I<br />guess 2k is still supposed to be "good enough".<br /><br />                Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
