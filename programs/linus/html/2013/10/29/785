If you have multiple callers, they might try to<br />free that one sd twice, since they could both see a non-NULL case.<br /><br />&gt; And we better be under the sysfs_mutex when the assignment and and<br />&gt; sysfs_remove_dir are called.<br /><br />Not as far as I can tell. kobject_del() calls sysfs_remove_dir(), and<br />I'm not seeing why that would be under the mutex.  The only locking I<br />see is that sysfs_assoc_lock, which _isn't_ held for the reading of<br />kobj-&gt;sd.<br /><br />Now, there may be other reasons for this all working (like the fact<br />that only one user ever calls kobject_del() on any particular object,<br />but it sure as hell isn't obvious. The fact that you seem to be<br />confused about this only proves my point.<br /><br />Besides, the "design pattern" of having a lock for the assignment, but<br />then reading the value without that lock seems to be all kinds of<br />f*cking stupid, wouldn't you agree? I'm really not seeing how that<br />could _ever_ be something you make excuses for in the first place.<br />Even if there is some external locking (which, as far as I can tell,<br />there is not), that would just raise the question as to what reason<br />that spinlock has to exist at all.<br /><br />The code doesn't make any sense with the locking the way it is now. It<br />might _work_, of course, but it sure as hell doesn't make sense.<br /><br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
