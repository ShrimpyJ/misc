But that's more a "I'll<br />let it slide for rc2-3" thing than any big concept, and it's<br />definitely not about rc7.<br /><br />And neither of those issues have ever made it acceptable to random<br />pointless churn. If it doesn't add support for new hardware, it's not<br />under some kind of "new hardware support" exception. And just "it's<br />new code, so we cannot possibly regress" is an excuse for making<br />slightly more invasive changes (especially to ABI's etc that need to<br />get fixed before a release), but it's not some blanket "we can do<br />anything" exception.<br /><br />And quite frankly, even the "new driver" exception was about hardware<br />that normal people actually are expected to use.  Things that are<br />relevant for a possibly large number of users. If it's something that<br />random people can be expected to pick up and use in Fry's or Office<br />Depot, we want to make sure we have a driver available as soon as<br />humanly possible.<br /><br />In contrast, if it's a driver for some enterprise hardware that is<br />only used by people who are going to run enterprise kernels anyway (ie<br />often several years down the line), there is ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to<br />merge it late in the release window. The enterprise users aren't using<br />bleeding edge kernels anyway, their time constraints are different.<br /><br />So if people thought it was some carte blanche for "anything goes",<br />people were confused.<br /><br />You need to think about *WHY* we had a "new driver" exception. And<br />realize that it probably will never actually be relevant for any SCSI<br />driver (not counting things like USB storage etc).<br /><br />          Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
