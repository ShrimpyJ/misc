Or have<br />CAP_SEARCH.<br /><br />And just not have any new LOOKUP_xyz flags at all. No special cases,<br />no different semantics for different ops, just check f_cred. Because<br />if you had the permissions to do the original open (ie f_cred matches<br />your current credentials), then that shows that you originally had all<br />the pathname permissions, and you are still the same person.<br /><br />And yeah, you may have opened in for reading (so the file is<br />technically read-only), but obviously we're re-doing all the inode<br />permission checks anyway, so the only thing /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/fd/&lt;n&gt; really<br />gave you was the path traversal. So we shouldn't bother with "the file<br />descriptor is only readable", because that is simply *irrelevant*.<br /><br />So it means that the case Andi brought up (truncating or<br />open-for-write a fd that we only had open for reading) would continue<br />to be allowed, because while it "sounds odd", there is no actual<br />problem.<br /><br />And CAP_SEARCH is very much about that path lookup again. So it's<br />consistent with the notion that "ok, you may do odd things to file<br />descriptors through /proc, but we check that you cannot avoid the<br />pathname lookup rules".<br /><br />And then we do exactly the same to flink(). So then we're all<br />consistent again. Not the consistency Andy worried about, but that's<br />the consistency that was was the security worries with flink are all<br />about. Because the issues with the "use the file descriptor, not the<br />path to the file descriptor" really are *not* about the endpoint<br />itself (since we will re-do the permission check for that particular<br />inode anyway), but about the path leading up to that end-point.<br /><br />                    Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
