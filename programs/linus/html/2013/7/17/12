Notice how the "Joseph" I replied to had deleted all the comments he wrote?<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Sorry, that completely escaped me.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;&gt; That should tell you something. I smacked down a troll.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt; If I was polite to you all those years ago, and I was polite but firm<br />&gt;&gt; in the two first responses, please give me credit for when I smack<br />&gt;&gt; somebody down. There may be a reason for it. The fact that the person<br />&gt;&gt; deleted his messages (or github deleted them for him - I have no idea<br />&gt;&gt; what their comment policy is) and you cannot see that context any more<br />&gt;&gt; online should not make you think that I suddenly went crazy.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Unfortunately, it seems I'm not the only one to be confused by this.<br /><br />Heh.<br /><br />I think this one is a pretty extreme example (because the context<br />simply is no longer *there*), but the fact is, it's not uncommon.<br /><br />People think I get all the credit (and hey, I do), but here's a<br />somewhat darker side to the story too. I get a lot of grief too, and<br />usually from people who don't have the context. In the blog you<br />posted, it was because the context simply wasn't there any more, but<br />let's be honest: even when the context is there, how many people read<br />it? It's a cesspool out there (*cough*slashdot*cough*).<br /><br />And hey, I think Sarah's outburst itself was due to a similar "I know<br />Linus curses at people, and who cares about context, it's never<br />acceptable". Because I guarantee that it was *not* because of the<br />actual email she replied to, or anything I've written her. Feel free<br />to go back and check.<br /><br />I'm really not complaining. It's part of my job, and I'm quite used to<br />it. This is not new. Certain people and places love to hate on Linus,<br />the egotistical ass. And hey, on the whole I can honestly say that I'm<br />*way* ahead. They aren't exactly wrong - it's not like I have a weak<br />ego. I get most annoyed when people say it's "new" and due to the<br />success of Linux. Dammit, I had a strong ego when I started this whole<br />thing, so don't try to chalk it all up to success.<br /><br />Guys, I love my job. The kernel developer community is great. But I<br />suspect that some of you don't necessarily think about the other side.<br />I had slashdot discussing my abusive relationship with my wife and<br />kids thanks to Sarah's comments. Talk about having a thick skin -<br />trust me when I tell you that I get as well as I give out.<br /><br />                 Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
