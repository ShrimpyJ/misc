There's no non-offensive way to tell a geek<br />&gt; "you are wrong", but this isn't even trying.  Bad Linus!<br /><br />You know what? Not my proudest moment. I was really upset.<br /><br />But that said, in my defense I actually think that one stands out. I<br />have written a lot of public emails, and that one line is probably the<br />single most over-the-line one. Or at least pretty close to the top.<br />And it's not so much because of the swearing, but because of the "shut<br />up" part. Or is that just me not reacting to swearwords again?<br /><br />Do I go overboard sometimes? Hell yes. But I get emotional about some<br />of this, and I not only think that's ok, I actually think it's<br />important. You mentioned the "lost the raw, red-hot anger of the<br />original", and I do think emotion is important to convey. It's not<br />just the message, it's also the fact that I'm really really pissed.<br /><br />Neil Brown here somewhere earlier said<br /><br />  "So my personal perspective on what it means to be responsible is:<br /><br />   Don't flame:  include the facts, exclude the emotion."<br /><br />and I can't overstate how much I disagree. You do need the factual<br />part too, but "exclude the emotion" is not good either.<br /><br />Emotions aren't bad. Quite the reverse. If we are expected to have a<br />sense of personal trust between the people involved (and quite<br />frankly, apart from just "technical excellence" I think personal trust<br />is just about the top criterion for good maintainers), I definitely<br />think that it's not about just about the facts. You need to hear the<br />*person* too. And some people are calm and don't swear, and that's<br />them. Others aren't.<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, I go overboard. Whatever. At least you guys know that when<br />I get emotional, I'm not going to come asking for a shoulder to cry<br />on.<br /><br />I think a little excessive swearing is less awkward for everybody in the end.<br /><br />            Linus<br /><br />Side note: the whole "trust the person" doesn't mean you have to like<br />that person. "Trust" is about having your expectations met, not<br />necessarily about those expectations always being all that positive. .<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
