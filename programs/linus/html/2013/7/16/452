The _only_ early<br />testers tend to be the people who saw the problem in the first place,<br />and the fact that a patch fixes it for *them* can be very very<br />misleading during that early testing phase. Because obviously that<br />self-selecting group of people were somehow fundamentally different<br />from the rest of the world, and different in a way that was very<br />particular to the problem.<br /><br />This is in particular what we've often seen with things like the PCI<br />layer resource management, and what we used to see a lot back in the<br />bad old days wrt suspend/resume. And it's why I'd really prefer for<br />even "obvious" patches to not be backported all that aggressively<br />unless there is very strong pressure. It's very much why that stable<br />documentation talks about "critical" issues.<br /><br />There have been tons of obvious patches that turned out to simply be<br />wrong - often for very non-obvious reasons. Even when they are small.<br />And the problems seldom get caught in early testing, often exactly<br />because of this self-selecting property of testers (and test*ing* -<br />when you fix a particular behavior, you tend to test the behavior<br />you're trying to fix, you don't test the other cases that the patch<br />wasn't about).<br /><br />Anyway, the point I'm making is that Q&amp;A is limited and often even<br />actively misleading ("Hey, I have three tested-by's, so it must be<br />fine"), and we might actually want to have a new class of<br />"non-critical patch that might be worth backporting to stable, but<br />only do so after it's been in a release for some time". Because while<br />it might be an "obvious" fix, maybe it's not critical enough that it<br />needs to be backported _now_ - maybe it could wait a month or two, and<br />get wider testing.<br /><br />               Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
