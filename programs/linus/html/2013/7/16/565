For example, Linus chose to<br />&gt; curse at Mauro [2] and Rafael [3], rather than their code:<br /><br />Umm. Because it was actually the person who was the problem?<br /><br />Trust me, there's a really easy way for me to curse at people: if you<br />are a maintainer, and you make excuses for your bugs rather than<br />trying to fix them, I will curse at *YOU*.<br /><br />Because then the problem really is you.<br /><br />And in *both* of the examples you cite, that was exactly the issue. It<br />wasn't that there was a bug - it was that the maintainer in question<br />basically refused to fix a regression.<br /><br />Sure, there was a code problem. But that wasn't the big issue. Code<br />can be broken, and can be utter crap, but as long as it's fixed, who<br />cares?<br /><br />But when top-level maintainers start ignoring the #1 rule in the<br />kernel ("We don't regress user space"), then it's not the broken code<br />that annoys me any more.<br /><br />See the difference?<br /><br />And yes, people who don't get this are people who I will literally<br />refuse to work with. In both of the cases you cite, things resolved<br />themselves quickly (in fact, with Rafael it was at least partially<br />just bad communication, and I haven't had that issue with him before).<br />Other people, who seem to treat regressions cavalierly, I will first<br />make it *very* clear that it is unacceptable, and then I will refuse<br />to take their patches. It has happened.<br /><br />And yes, if that's the reason some person doesn't like working with<br />the kernel ("Linus screams at me when I break things and don't want to<br />fix them"), then dammit, good f*cking riddance. I already saw exactly<br />that comment on G+ earlier today - somebody who is well-known for not<br />fixing his regressions ("fix your user instead") was talking about how<br />he doesn't want to work with me for that very reason.<br /><br />So apparently my cursing works.<br /><br />Seriously, Sarah, you need to get off this "you can't curse at<br />people". Because you *can* curse at people, and it very much is<br />sometimes called for.<br /><br />               Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
