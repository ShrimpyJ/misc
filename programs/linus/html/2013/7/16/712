Notice how the "Joseph" I replied to had deleted all the comments he wrote?<br /><br />That should tell you something. I smacked down a troll.<br /><br />If I was polite to you all those years ago, and I was polite but firm<br />in the two first responses, please give me credit for when I smack<br />somebody down. There may be a reason for it. The fact that the person<br />deleted his messages (or github deleted them for him - I have no idea<br />what their comment policy is) and you cannot see that context any more<br />online should not make you think that I suddenly went crazy.<br /><br />Btw, since I get the github messages in email too, I have a copy.<br />Joseph replied to those "polite but firm" messages where I explained<br />exactly *why* I don't want to bother with github pull requests with<br />this gem:<br /><br />   "I did not realizes that Linus' shit does not stink.  Thanks for<br />clearing that up..."<br /><br />Quite frankly, I think I was quite polite enough. Exactly *because* I<br />had been polite but firm before that injection.<br /><br />The fact is, I don't suffer fools nicely. I call it like I see it, and<br />I called him a moron for entering the discussion with a totally<br />content-free comment.<br /><br />Feel free to disagree. Maybe you see some value in the troll comment?<br /><br />And I somehow suspect that your message that I replied to back in 1999<br />was somehow more relevant? Yes? No?<br /><br />                 Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
