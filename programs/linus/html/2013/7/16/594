But it was kind of fun to watch you go ballistic by mistake. ;-)<br /><br />And that's why I actually mentioned in my reply to Sarah that "(in<br />fact, with Rafael it was at least partially just bad communication,<br />and I haven't had that issue with him before)", because I have this<br />distinct memory that we ended up having that exact discussion about<br />misunderstanding and bad wording at the time.<br /><br />I react very strongly when somebody argues against fixing regressions.<br />Let's just say that there's too many years of baggage that I carry<br />around on that issue..<br /><br />So that is definitely one of the things that make me go ballistic.<br />Buggy code isn't actually one of them. Bugs happen. Even really stupid<br />bugs happen, and happen to good people. They had a bad day, or it was<br />just a brainfart.  Not that I will be _polite_ about bad code, mind<br />you, and there might be some bad words in there, but it doesn't make<br />me blow up.<br /><br />Being cavalier about known regressions is definitely the primary<br />trigger. I suspect there are others, but I can't seem to recall any<br />other particular hot-button issues right now. Maybe Sarah can post a<br />few more pointers..<br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
