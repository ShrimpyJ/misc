Everybody has been gossiping around the water cooler instead,<br />and I've had one or two pull requests per day from the people who are<br />happily oblivious (or too smarter to get involved) about the whole<br />flame fest.<br /><br />I'm cantankerous, and hard to please. Send me too much and I yell, and<br />send me too little and I yell.  Because I'm the Goldilocks of kernel<br />development, and I want my pull requests "just right". And clearly all<br />the energy has been going into arguing, not working.<br /><br />Shoo, shoo. Back to your desks. Don't all congregate in the break room.<br /><br />                    Linus<br /><br />PS Or maybe you're just being professional and biding your time, and<br />everybody is planning on sending me the work they when they clock out<br />on Friday at 5PM.
