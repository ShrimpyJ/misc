Linus, you're one of the worst<br />&gt; offenders when it comes to verbally abusing people and publicly tearing<br />&gt; their emotions apart.<br /><br />Yes. And I do it partly (mostly) because it's who I am, and partly<br />because I honestly despise being subtle or "nice".<br /><br />The fact is, people need to know what my position on things are. And I<br />can't just say "please don't do that", because people won't listen. I<br />say "On the internet, nobody can hear you being subtle", and I mean<br />it.<br /><br />And I definitely am not willing to string people along, either. I've<br />had that happen too - not telling people clearly enough that I don't<br />like their approach, they go on to re-architect something, and get<br />really upset when I am then not willing to take their work.<br /><br />Sarah, first off, I don't have that many tools at hand. Secondly, I<br />simply don't believe in being polite or politically correct. And you<br />can point at all those cultural factors where some cultures are not<br />happy with confrontation (and feel free to make it about gender too -<br />I think that's almost entirely cultural too). And please bring up<br />"cultural sensitivity" while at it. And I'll give you back that same<br />"cultural sensitivity". Please be sensitive to _my_ culture too.<br /><br />Google "management by perkele".<br /><br />Do you really want to oppress a minority? Because Finns are a minority<br />compared to almost any other country. If you want to talk cultural<br />sensitivity, I'll join you. But my culture includes cursing.<br /><br />And some of the above is written tonge-in-cheek, but all of it is also<br />serious. I really fundamentally believe that being honest and open<br />about your emotions about core/process is good. And because it's damn<br />hard to read people over email, I think you need to be *more* honest<br />and *more* open over email. I'm generally nicer in person. Not always.<br /><br />And yes, I'll happily be part of the discussion at the KS. But I think<br />you also need to be aware that your "high horse" isn't necessarily all<br />that high.<br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
