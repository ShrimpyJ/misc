I'm not aware pf anything that has changed in this area since<br />3.10 - neither in execve, xfs or in splice. Not even since 3.9.<br /><br />But I may certainly have missed something.<br /><br />&gt; Interestingly, the 'soft lockups' I was<br />&gt; seeing all the time on that box seem to have gone into hiding.<br /><br />Honestly, I'm somewhat inclined to blame the whole perf situation, and<br />saying that we hopefully got that fixed. In between the silly do_div()<br />buglets and all the indications that the time was spent in nmi<br />handlers, I'd be willing to just ignore them as false positives<br />brought on by the whole switch to the perf irq..<br /><br />&gt;  &gt; Or is the XFS i_iolock required for this thing to happen at all?<br />&gt;  &gt; Adding Ben Myers to the cc just for luck/completeness.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; It is only happening (so far) on the XFS test box, but I don't have<br />&gt; enough data to say that's definite yet.<br /><br />.. so there's been a number of xfs changes, and I don't know the code,<br />but none of them seem at all relevant to this.<br /><br />The "pipe -&gt; cred_guard_mutex" lock chain is pretty direct, and can be<br />clearly attributed to splicing into /proc. Now, whether that is a<br />*good* idea or not is clearly debatable, and I do think that maybe we<br />should just not splice to/from proc files, but that doesn't seem to be<br />new, and I don't think it's necessarily *broken* per se, it's just<br />that splicing into /proc seems somewhat unnecessary, and various proc<br />files do end up taking locks that can be "interesting".<br /><br />At the other end of the spectrum, the "cred_guard_mutex -&gt; FS locks"<br />thing from execve() is also pretty clear, and probably not fixable or<br />necessarily something we'd even want to fix.<br /><br />But the "FS locks -&gt; pipe" part is a bit questionable. Honestly, I'd<br />be much happier if XFS used generic_file_splice_read/write().<br /><br />And looking more at that, I'm actually starting to think this is an<br />XFS locking problem. XFS really should not call back to splice while<br />holding the inode lock.<br /><br />But that XFS code doesn't seem new either. Is XFS a new thing for you<br />to test with?<br /><br />Ben? Comments? I added the xfs list too now that I'm starting to<br />possibly blame XFS more actively..<br /><br />                  Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
