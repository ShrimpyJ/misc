Which means that even if the upcoming one is "perfect", things <br />will be wrong with it, if only because people will have new usage <br />scenarios where the standard simply isn't relevant or that it otherwise <br />just doesn't address, and that then gets us back to the same issues <br />somewhere else.<br /><br />So it would be much better if developers just didn't think the standard <br />trumped "real and existing code and problems", and shot down the language <br />lawyers (and don't get me wrong - it's not just in gcc, btw. We _have_ had <br />some of the same behavior in the kernel, although I will argue that our <br />"backwards compatibility trumps pretty much everything else" rules at <br />least solves _some_ of the problems).<br /><br />Standards are just papers. Yes, they're important, but they are definitely <br />not more important than anything else, and they are a lot _less_ important <br />than some people seem to think. Gcc has done more for programming by being <br />a de-facto standard and widely available, than the _paper_ standards often <br />ever do!<br /><br />It's also sad that a lot of these things seem to be done in the name of <br />optimizing code, and then in many cases it drives people *away* from using <br />that optimizer for anything but benchmarking.<br /><br />In the kernel, we historically used to try for extreme optimizations, <br />these days we spend more time tuning the optimizations _down_ because they <br />aren't optimizations at all (ie using -Os instead of -O2), or they were <br />buggy enough that we have to explicitly disable them (aliasing, <br />"unit-at-a-time" etc).<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
