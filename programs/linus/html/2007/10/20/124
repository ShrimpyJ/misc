The latest release (1.5.3.4) has this problem.<br /><br />Yes. It's ok in the master branch, but due to unlucky timing with noticing <br />this bug, and Junio being away, no releases got cut with the fix. <br /><br />In general, the kernel people haven't done many renames (I think it's <br />something we have avoided historically, just because it makes diffs almost <br />totally unreadable - even while git supports "rename diffs", they are <br />turned off by default just to be compatible with people who use quilt and <br />raw patch).<br /><br />So we've basically had a "perfect storm" of (a) Junio being away, (b) a <br />really stupid bug that got introduced recently, (c) a few broken <br />heuristics that had little testing because the kernel almost never does <br />renames anyway and (d) suddenly lots of renames in the kernel all at once.<br /><br />(It's not even just the x86 stuff - we had all the watchdog drivers being <br />moved around too, so we probably had almost as many renames the last two <br />weeks than we've had in the two years preceding it ;)<br /><br />[ Just for fun, I checked. Yup. In the last two weeks, git finds 1120 <br />  copies and renames. Over the last two and a half years (ie the whole git <br />  timeframe), we have 2136 of them. So we really have done more renames in <br />  the last two weeks than we have over the whole rest of the git history,<br />  and it wasn't just my imagination ]<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
