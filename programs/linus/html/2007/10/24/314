If you want a full<br />&gt; time person, who did you have in mind?<br /><br />Quite frankly, at least for me personally, what I would rather have (in <br />general: this is really not at all SCSI-specific in any way, shape, or <br />form, and not directed at James!) is a less rigid maintainership <br />structure.<br /><br />Let's face it, we are *all* likely to be overworked at different times, <br />and even when not overworked, it's just the fact that people need to take <br />a breather etc. And there is seldom - if ever - a very strong argument for <br />having one person per subsystem.<br /><br />I think git is excellent for trying to spreading the "joy" of <br />maintainership, but even without something like that, I think it's much <br />better to try to find people you can trust, rather than strict <br />maintainership boundaries. For example, Andrew certainly seems to be very <br />productive as a kernel maintainer, and it has nothing to do with git, and <br />everything to do with trust.<br /><br />So I'd rather have less recriminations about "xyz is holding up abc", and <br />have people more open to just trying to help out even across strict <br />borders. And I don't mean that in a "two fighting people" kind of way <br />where there are two or more people who maintain things _despite_ each <br />other, but more in a <br /><br />  "Hey we know each other, and we trust each other, and no, we won't <br />   guarantee that we always agree, but we can work on things, and if it <br />   turns out that one person merged somethign that the other person <br />   _really_ doesn't like, we'll revert it and/or work it out some other <br />   way".<br /><br />I've personally always been against _strict_ maintainer lines, so I've <br />always taken stuff "past" the maintainer anyway (and sometimes maintainers <br />have complained, because they feel like they "own" their subsystem, and I <br />either tell them to stuff it, or say "my bad", depending on whether they <br />had a valid _technical_ complaint or not).<br /><br />So rather than getting into a pissing match of "ok, who would be the best <br />maintainer", I'd much *much* prefer to take this as another "we really <br />don't need or even _want_ to have strict maintainer rules" opportunity.<br /><br />Now, the most important part here is the trust part. I need to be able to <br />trust maintainers, but when you have multiple people in the same "box", <br />those people need to trust each other even more than usual, because you <br />*are* going to get disagreements. And the only way it can work is if you <br />acknowledge that disagreements will happen, and that any situation is  not <br />a "my way or the highway" kind of thing - the trust also implies a certain <br />give and take.<br /><br />And this really *is* an issue that cuts across subsystem boundaries. <br />Anybody who thinks that SCSI is "unique" in this kind of issues is sadly <br />mistaken. We've had the exact same thing come up in every single subsystem <br />over time, and at every single level of maintainership (from individual <br />drivers all the way right up to me) over time.<br /><br />So I *really* don't want to throw any stones in a glass house here. Quite <br />the reverse. I'd like to get rid of some of the glass, and replace it with <br />padding. Because you all know we'd all fit better in a padded room than a <br />glass house..<br /><br />Are there any such people that think there s a sufficient mutual trust <br />with James that you think a blurring of maintainership lines could work <br />out? Or in any other subsystem, for that matter?
