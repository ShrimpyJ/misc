So I'll say that I'm a bit <br />nervous about extending it again.<br /><br />The reason for the three dashes is actually that that is what a *diff* <br />starts with. So if you look at what "closes" a description as far as <br />git-am is concerned, they are currently all things that are likely to <br />start a patch: "Index: " or "diff -" or "--- &lt;filename&gt;", and that last <br />case was then extended to be "manual break" even without the filename <br />information.<br /><br />See git/builtin-mailinfo.c: patchbreak().<br /><br />But you could try to sell it to Junio. He's the maintainer, and while I <br />care about some other things and will argue violently against them, when <br />it comes to something like this, Junio is the guy to go to.<br /><br />That said, I really think you could just try to educate the people you <br />work with. Maybe they just never even realized that "three dashes" is what <br />you're supposed to use!<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
