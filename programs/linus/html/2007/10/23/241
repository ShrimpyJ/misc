So <br />I'll just take this opportunity to ask people that when they send <br />bug-fixes, please try to make the subject line and message make sense for <br />a *reader*, not for yourself (or even to me, although if it's readable to <br />some generic person, it's hopefully readable to me too!).<br /><br />So a subject line of "Bugfix to commit &lt;commit-sha-goes-here&gt;" is <br />obviously not a very nice one, if you're looking at the kernel commit <br />history in gitk or some other visualizer that shows the first line as the <br />subject for the whole commit. It just doesn't make any sense to the <br />reader!<br /><br />Related to that, another thing that also happens is that people write <br />subject lines (and the description) as if everybody realized that <br />something is particular to that architecture or driver. It may be true <br />that that particular developer (or development list) is only about ppc, <br />and then people write subject lines like "Fix execve() argument handling", <br />but again, when a *generic* person reads that, it now reads totally wrong, <br />since it wasn't execve() in general, it was a particular architecture that <br />it went wrong for.<br /><br />So the rule should be:<br /><br /> - if it's not fairly generic, specify the area (architecture, subsystem, <br />   driver) that the fix is for in the subject line. Even if you end up <br />   initially sending the fix out to just a list that handles that <br />   particular subsystem anyway.<br /><br /> - don't use commit names in the subject line - and while it's great to <br />   use them in the body of the explanation, even there you don't want to <br />   assume that people read it from within git. People see patches and <br />   commit changelogs on the web or the commit mailing lists, so when <br />   specifying an exact version, also specify the human-readable name of <br />   that version.<br /><br /> - write the commit message for an outsider, and use whitespace. The <br />   third-most common fixup I end up doing (after the above two) is to <br />   split things up into shorter paragraphs, after somebody wrote a good <br />   changelog entry, but made it one large unreadable blob of text. The <br />   more involved and technical some description is (and that's what long <br />   changelog entries should be - we don't want a fluffy novella here!), <br />   the more "breather space" and individually understandable small <br />   snippets of text readers need. Making things too dense is bad.<br /><br />Anyway, this was in no way meant to be a specific problem for Grant or <br />Olaf - I end up editing just about half of all the commit messages of <br />stuff I get in email (except for Andrew's stuff, since Andrew largely does <br />the same kinds of cleanups anyway, so I only need to edit up a small <br />percentage of the patches he forwards). I'd like it to be *much* less than <br />that, so I thought I should speak up since I had an example of this.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
