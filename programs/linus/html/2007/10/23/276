The point of sign-offs is that it <br />makes the copyright and flow of patches explicit, so an "implicit <br />sign-off" would defeat the whole point.<br /><br />&gt; Test was done privately, Sami helped to narrow down the trouble, but<br />&gt; he didn't test the last patch, nothing bad on Sami side, I was too<br />&gt; confident the fix was obvious after narrowing it.<br /><br />Well, I just wanted an ack that it was tested, since it seemed a bit <br />subtle and (like the sign-offs) that explicit "yes, this was tested" was <br />missing. Looks like I was right in asking for it:<br /><br />&gt; &gt; The previous patch I tested by Philippe, oprof-fix-profile_pc-use.patch,<br />&gt; &gt; worked ok, but with this latest patch oprofiled aborts.<br />&gt; &gt; But kernel does not oops or print msgs.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; argh, I just moved the wrong eip from kernel to user space where the same<br />&gt; problem occur too, *sighs*, since I can't reproduce Sami problem, my own<br />&gt; test obviously worked...<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Sami, can you test this new patch. After testing can you report<br />&gt; the contents of /dev/oprofile/stats/cpu*/sample_invalid_eip ?<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Linus, there is two way to fix this problem, the attached patch fix it<br />&gt; by sanitizing the sampled eip,<br /><br />I'm perfectly happy with the attached patch, I just want it to be <br />properly tested and have all the sign-offs (and explanations etc) in <br />place, and I can apply it.<br /><br />Of course, I cannot think of a single architecture where an EIP of ~0UL is <br />valid anyway, so I'm also not opposed to just keeping ~0UL as the magic <br />value.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
