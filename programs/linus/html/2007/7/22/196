The diff<br />&gt; &gt; handling is already some of the more complex parts (and very central), it<br />&gt; &gt; would be much simpler and efficient to not try to make that thing fancier,<br />&gt; &gt; and instead solve the problem at the front-end.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; These diffs are coming from companies doing GPL compliance without<br />&gt; really wanting to comply. CVS servers are not made available.<br /><br />That wasn't what I said. <br /><br />You want to supporess the CVS keyword expansion.<br /><br />I'm telling you that you should just do so.<br /><br />But I'm *also* telling you that this has nothing to do with "git diff".<br /><br />The way to get "git diff" to not show the CVS expansion is to *remove* the <br />CVS expansion. By simply running some pre-processing on the patches <br />*before* you put them into git in the first place (or, like Dscho <br />suggested: you could do it later too, by using git filter-branch).<br /><br />Once you have the version that doesn't have the CVS log, "git diff" will <br />automatically do the rigth thing.<br /><br />In other words, I'm just saying that you're trying to solve the wrong <br />problem. Once you solve the *right* problem, the wrong problem just goes <br />away.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
