Ok, got <br />&gt; that.<br /><br />But I wanted to bring out more than what you make sound like "that's what <br />happened, deal with it". I tried to explain _why_ the choices that were <br />made were in fact made.<br /><br />And it's a (I think) important thing for people to be aware of. The fact <br />is, "personality" and "work with the other developers" is a big issue.<br /><br />You cannot just go off and do your own thing in your private world, and <br />then expect it to be accepted without any discussion or other people <br />showing up and doing alternate things. That's _especially_ true in an area <br />that has a respected and working maintainer.<br /><br />&gt;	 Yet, Con walked away (and not just over SD). Seeing Con go, I wonder <br />&gt; how many did leave without this splash.<br /><br />We've had people go with a splash before. Quite frankly, the current <br />scheduler situation looks very much like the CML2 situation. Anybody <br />remember that? The developer there also got rejected, the improvement was <br />made differently (and much more in line with existing practices and <br />maintainership), and life went on. Eric Raymond, however, left with a <br />splash.<br /><br />It's not common, but it's not unheard of. Anybody who thinks that <br />developers don't have huge egos probably haven't ever met a software <br />engineer. And I suspect kernel people have bigger egos than most. No <br />wonder there are clashes every once in a while - it's a wonder there <br />aren't _more_ of them.<br /><br />&gt; How and why? And is it due to a deeper problem?<br /><br />Well, one part of it is that the way to make changes in the kernel <br />community is to do them incrementally.<br /><br />Small and incremental improvements are much easier to merge. If you go off <br />and rewrite a subsystem, you shouldn't expect it to get merged, at least <br />not unless it can live side-by-side with the old one (the new firewire <br />stack is an example of that, and most filesystems are this way too). And <br />the closer to some central part you get, the harder that gets.<br /><br />So the *bulk* of the kernel stuff can be handled either incrementally, or <br />side-by-side, and as a result, you actually seldom see issues like this. <br />The kernel is extremely modular, and a large reason for that is exactly to <br />avoid couplings.<br /><br />Some (very few) things cannot be done incrementally. That's why I bring <br />up CML2 as a fairly good example of this having happened before. Some <br />things require flag-days. But you should pretty much *assume* that if <br />there is a flag-day, and if there is a maintainer, the maintainer has to <br />be involved.<br /><br />Does "maintainership" give infinite powers? No. I'll take patches that <br />bypass maintainers, but there needs to be some reason for them (ie in some <br />sense the maintainer needs to have done a bad job, or the patch just needs <br />to be trivial enough - or it cuts across maintainership areas - that it's <br />not even _worth_ going through all maintainers).<br /><br />So maintainers aren't "everything". But they are important. You can't just <br />ignore them and go do your own thing, and then expect it to be merged.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
