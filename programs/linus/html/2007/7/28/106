The response on osnews.com etc have shown that there is public<br />&gt; demand for it too.<br /><br />No, the response on osnews.com only shows that there are a lot of armchair <br />complainers around.<br /><br />People are suggesting that you'd have a separate "desktop kernel". That's <br />insane. It also shows total ignorance of maintainership, and reality. And <br />I bet most of the people there haven't tested _either_ scheduler, they <br />just like making statements.<br /><br />The fact is, I've _always_ considered the desktop to be the most important <br />part. And I suspect that that actually is true for most kernel developers, <br />because quite frankly, that's what 99% of them ends up using. If a kernel <br />developer uses Windows for his day-to-day work, I sure as hell wouldn't <br />want to have him developing Linux. That has nothing to do with anything <br />anti-windows: but the whole "eat your own dogfood" is a very fundamental <br />thing, and somebody who doesn't do that shouldn't be allowed to be even <br />_close_ to a compiler!<br /><br />So the whole argument about how kernel developers think that the desktop <br />isn't important is totally made-up crap by Con, and then parrotted by <br />osnews and other places.<br /><br />The fact is, most kernel developers realize that Linux is used in <br />different places, on different machines, and with different loads. You <br />cannot make _everybody_ happy, but you can try to do as good a job as <br />possible. And doing "as good a job as possible" very much includes not <br />focusing on any particular load.<br /><br />And btw, "the desktop" isn't actually one single load. It's in fact a lot <br />of very different loads, and different people want different things. What <br />makes the desktop so interesting is in fact that it shows more varied <br />usage than any other niche - and no, 3D gaming isn't "it". <br /><br />&gt; Maybe once or twice Con couldn't help or fix an issue but isn't that what<br />&gt; open source software is all about anyway?<br /><br />That's not the issue. <br /><br />Con wass fixated on one thing, and one thing only, and wasn't interested <br />in anythign else - and attacked people who complained. Compare that to <br />Ingo, who saw that what Con's scheduler did was good, and tried to solve <br />the problems of people who complained.<br /><br />The ck mailing list is/was also apparently filled with people who all had <br />the same issues, which is seriously the *wrong* thing to do. It means that <br />any "consensus" coming out of that kind of private list is totally <br />worthless, because the people you ask are already in agreement - you have <br />a so-called "selection bias", and they just reinforce their own opinions.<br /><br />Which is why I don't trust mailing lists with a narrow topic. They are <br />_useless_. If you cannot get many different people from _different_ areas <br />to test your patches, and cannot see the big picture, the end result won't <br />likely be very interesting to others, will it?<br /><br />The fact is, _any_ scheduler is going to have issues. I will bet you <br />almost any amount of money that people are going to complain about Ingo's <br />scheduler when 2.6.23 is released. That's not the issue: the issue is that <br />the exact same thing would have happened with CK too.<br /><br />So if you are going to have issues with the scheduler, which one do you <br />pick: the one where the maintainer has shown that he can maintain <br />schedulers for years, can can address problems from _different_ areas of <br />life? Or the one where the maintainer argues against people who report <br />problems, and is fixated on one single load?<br /><br />That's really what it boils down to. I was actually planning to merge CK <br />for a while. The _code_ didn't faze me.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
