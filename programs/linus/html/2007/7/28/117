Frankly, im not just thinking of myself.<br /><br />Ok, good. Has anybody tried to figure out why 3D games seem to be such a <br />special case? <br /><br />I know Ingo looked at it, and seemed to think that he found and fixed <br />something. But it sounds like it's worth a lot more discussion.<br /><br />&gt; Okay, i wasnt going to ask, but ill do it anyway, did you even read the<br />&gt; threads about SD?<br /><br />I don't _ever_ go on specialty mailing lists. I don't read -mm, and I <br />don't read the -fs mailing lists. I don't think they are interesting. <br /><br />And I tried to explain why: people who concentrate on one thing tend to <br />become this self-selecting group that never looks at anything else, and <br />then rejects outside input from people who hadn't become part of the "mind <br />meld". <br /><br />That's what I think I saw - I saw the reactions from where external people <br />were talking and cc'ing me.<br /><br />And yes, it's quite possible that I also got a very one-sided picture of <br />it. I'm not disputing that. Con was also ill for a rather critical period, <br />which was certainly not helping it all.<br /><br />&gt; Con was extremely polite to everyone, and he did work<br />&gt; with a multitude of people, you seem to be totally deadlocked into the<br />&gt; ONE incident with a person that was unhappy with SD, simply for being a<br />&gt; fair scheduler.<br /><br />Hey, maybe that one incident just ended up being a rather big portion of <br />what I saw. Too bad. That said, the end result (Con's public gripes about <br />other kernel developers) mostly reinforced my opinion that I did the right <br />choice.<br /><br />But maybe you can show a better side of it all. I don't think _any_ <br />scheduler is perfect, and almost all of the time, the RightAnswer(tm) ends <br />up being not "one or the other", but "somewhere in between".<br /><br />It's not like we've come to the end of the road: the baseline has just <br />improved. If you guys can show that SD actually is better at some loads, <br />without penalizing others, we can (and will) revisit this issue.<br /><br />So what you should take away from this is that: from what I saw over the <br />last couple of months, it really wasn't much of a decision. The difference <br />in how Ingo and Con reacted to peoples reports was pretty stark. And no, I <br />haven't followed the ck mailing list, and so yes, I obviously did get just <br />a part of the picture, but the part I got was pretty damn unambiguous.<br /><br />But at the same time, no technical decision is ever written in stone. It's <br />all a balancing act. I've replaced the scheduler before, I'm 100% sure <br />we'll replace it again. Schedulers are actually not at all that important <br />in the end: they are a very very small detail in the kernel.<br /><br />				Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
