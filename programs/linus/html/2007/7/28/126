Apparently, one person complaining about SD was reason to keep <br />&gt; it out <a href="http://osnews.com/permalink.php?news_id=18350&amp;comment_id=258997">http://osnews.com/permalink.php?news_id=18350&amp;comment_id=258997</a><br />&gt; <br />&gt; Will this first post stop CFS from entering the kernel?<br /><br />You seem to be not understanding the argument.<br /><br />It wasn't about "one person complaining". Of *course* people will <br />complain. That always happens, and sometimes with totally bogus complaints <br />(the most common being "I'm not used to it").<br /><br />The problem was the reaction to complaints. <br /><br />Ingo got lots of complaints too. He was very responsive to them (which is <br />not something surprising - he's been doing this a long time), and while <br />some of the tangents he went off on were definitely bogus (the whole <br />renicing thing), they were still useful as part of the discussion.<br /><br />And Ingo got other - totally unrelated - developers involved too, ie the <br />group fairness logic came from Vatsa. And he ended up supporting not just <br />scheduler people, but also talking to the block layer people ahout the <br />scheduler timer usage as a fast clock for block requests etc.<br /><br />And you have to realize that to me, as the top-level maintainer and one <br />who seldom actually does big coding things, but just ends up making sure <br />that people work with others, and fix the problems that crop up, *that* <br />kind of behaviour is much much MUCH more important than the code itself.<br /><br />Can you see that?<br /><br />Can you see how big of a difference those whole approaches make? <br /><br />&gt; Now I'll try to be a bit more constructive. I hope your benevolent <br />&gt; dictatorship allows self reflection.<br /><br />Nobody is very good at self-reflection, I'm afraid. <br /><br />&gt; Sure, the difference in behaviour (not in code) between SD and CFS is small, <br />&gt; and for me it doesn't matter. I'm fine with CFS in the kernel, it's a huge <br />&gt; improvement over the previous one. But why, while there was a seemingly good <br />&gt; alternative, did THAT one stay in that long? And this argument goes for more <br />&gt; code 'out there', btw.<br /><br />Actually, nobody pushed SD to me, and neither Con nor anybody else tried <br />to get me to merge it until some time in March of this year, I think.<br /><br />Do you think I go trolling for code to merge? No. I actually _require_ <br />that people send it to me, and that I also get the feeling that people are <br />asking for it! <br /><br />In other words, my job is not to "merge code" (even though I sometimes <br />describe it that way), my job is actually largely to "say no". You <br />shouldn't see me as the person who goes out and tries to get everything <br />together - quite the reverse. My job is to say "too late for the merge <br />window", or "too experimental", or "you need to show numbers" or "are <br />there going to be any _users_ for this"?<br /><br />&gt;  Some things get into the kernel, other don't. Some get in too soon, others <br />&gt; too late. Sure. But shouldn't we try to improve this process, instead of <br />&gt; saying 'it is what it is, get over it'?<br /><br />Umm. The absolute *last* thing we want to do is to merge earlier. In fact, <br />one of our biggest problems is that people send half-cooked stuff to me <br />(and even more so, to Andrew). <br /><br />So in this case, if you've been on the CK mailing list, ask yourself: why <br />wasn't parts of it pushed up to the standard kernel? Asking "why didn't <br />Linus take it earlier" is exactly the wrong thing to do, since nobody even <br />_asked_ me to. I never _ever_ got a patch saying "please merge this".<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />(Btw, on that note: please don't send me patches saying "please merge <br />this". I want more than just that. I want an explanation, and I want it to <br />be in many small pieces, and I want to feel like it got tested and is <br />likely to be an obvious improvement).<br /><br />So now look at what happened to CFS:<br /><br /> - Ingo pushed it, and has been a maintainer of the area and shown himself <br />   over years to be able to work with others and react to reports of <br />   problems.<br /><br /> - It was fairly obviously an improvement over the previous status quo<br />   (although I expect that there will be regressions - almost nothing is <br />   ever a _pure_ improvement, if it's in any way non-trivial)<br /><br /> - Even so, I asked for (and got) a series of independent patches.<br /><br />Compare this to SD for a while.
