And maybe split it into reviewable chunks<br />&gt; while I'm at it ;)<br /><br />Hey, I appreciate it, but I really do have to warn you that I did this all <br />blind, and just meant for it to be a "I think this kind of direction is <br />more productive" thing. I'm not going to guarantee that it works at all.<br /><br />I spent more time than I really wanted to on actually making sure the end <br />result even compiles (quite often, I'm perfectly happy to just send out <br />pseudo-code to indicate what I think should be done), but maybe I <br />shouldn't have done that, just so that nobody thinks that the patch is <br />necessarily going to *work*.<br /><br />In other words, it's a totally mindless cleanup and re-factorization. It <br />*may* work, but quite frankly, I did it just for that one email, and spent <br />the absolutly minimum possible time thinking about it. As a result, I <br />really think it needs some serious looking over.<br /><br />I also think that my new "handle_raddr_seg()" function could itself be <br />split up into subfunctions along the "switch()" subcases.<br /><br />So not only wasn't it meant to be guaranteed correct, but it wasn't even <br />meant to be seen as the best possible final situation: it could be - and <br />should be - factored out even more (and the same goes for a lot of the <br />other functions in that file that I didn't really look at, just glance and <br />notice that they have some of the same problem patterns).<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
