If keeping the old<br />&gt; prefix is more acceptable, I can create a new patch without the<br />&gt; "v9fs_"-&gt;"p9_" renames.<br /><br />It's fine, I don't care *that* much, and I already pulled. If it had been <br />something more central, I'd have rejected it, but soemthing as specialized <br />as the Plan9 fs, I just wanted to point out that this is now how we should <br />do things.<br /><br />In other words: when doing renames it is generally *much* nicer to do a <br />100% rename (perhaps with just _trivial_ changes to make it compile - the <br />include statements etc change, and maybe you want to change the name in <br />the comment header too).<br /><br />Doing "move the code and change it at the same time" is considered bad <br />form. Movement diffs are much harder to read anyway (a traditional diff <br />will show it as a new-file + delete, of course), so the general rule is:<br /><br /> - move code around _without_ modifying it, so that code movement (whether <br />   it's a whole file, or just a set of functions between files) doesn't <br />   really introduce any real changes, and is easier to look through the <br />   changes.<br /><br /> - do the actual changes to the code as a separate thing.<br /><br />This should be true in just about *any* development model, and it's <br />especially true in Linux, where patches are the main way people <br />communicate.<br /><br />And when using git, the whole "keep code movement separate from changes" <br />has an even more fundamental reason: git can track code movement (again, <br />whether moving a whole file or just a function between files), and doing a <br />"git blame -C" will actually follow code movement between files. It does <br />that by similarity analysis, but it does mean that if you both move the <br />code *and* change it at the same time, git cannot see that "oh, that <br />function came originally from that other file", and now you get worse <br />annotations about where code actually originated.<br /><br />So next time, please don't move code and change it at the same time.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
