It's very <br />possible that the BIOS writers were *intending* to prefer ACPI 2.0, and it <br />may even be likely that they thought that they wrote it that way, but the <br />real issue is that it has apparently never ever been *tested* that way.<br /><br />So yes, maybe the vendors actually thought they were a good ACPI-2.0 <br />implementation, but if Windows doesn't do the ordering that the 2.0 spec <br />expects, then that is pretty much just a theoretical thing.<br /><br />But yeah, it would be really nice to have this verified some way. Somebody <br />must already know (whether it's a VM person or a BIOS writer, and whether <br />they'd tell us, is obviously another issue).<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
