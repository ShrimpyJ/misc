I hope it still means that in the eventual<br />&gt; merged state, GIT will be aware of all the renames.<br /><br />Git doesn't care. You can do renames by hand, or with "git mv", you can do <br />them as a delete/create pair, you can use "git-apply" with a rename patch, <br />and you can do them by re-typing in all of the file contents from scratch.<br /><br />Regardless of how the rename is done, git will represent the data the <br />exact same way: the state of the tree before and after. <br /><br />The rename-patches are a lot denser and a lot more readable for humans (ie <br />you can actually see what *happens*, unlike a traditional stupid unified <br />diff), and I was hoping that eventually somebody in the GNU patch <br />community would see how wonderful the extended patch information is, but <br />when I tried to write a patch to "patch" to do it, I almost dug out my <br />eyes with spoons from looking at the source code, so I haven't actually <br />helped it happen.<br /><br />So you can ask for patches in traditional format (*most* git command lines <br />will default to that anyway, and only give a copy-patch with -C or -M on <br />the command line), or people could realize that "git-apply" actually works <br />even on non-git source code, and just stop using that abomination that is <br />"patch" with all of it's totally wrong and unsafe defaults (*).<br /><br />But whatever works. I'm currently skipping the patches since they didn't <br />seem like 2.6.24 fodder anyway.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br />(*) Let me count the ways: applying patches partially when it fails <br />half-way through a series. Defaulting to totally randomly guessing the <br />path-name skip depth when not explicitly given a -pX option. Defaulting to <br />"--fuzz=2" which is almost guaranteed to apply a patch even when it makes <br />no sense what-so-ever. Yes, git-apply has stricter rules, but they are <br />stricter for damn good reasons. For people who want the insane unsafe GNU <br />patch defaults, they just have to specifically ask for unsafe modes..<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
