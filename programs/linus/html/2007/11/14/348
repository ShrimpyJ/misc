If there isn't a fix available within <br />a day or two, it should get reverted.<br /><br />The "fix" can then be re-applying the *fixed* patch - and at that point we <br />should strive to require the person who re-submits the patch (with fixes) <br />having to have an Ack from the person who found the problem in the first <br />place, so that it's verified to actually fix things!<br /><br />So I really would encourage people to send me emails like<br /><br />	Please revert commit xyz, because it breaks abc, and there is no <br />	fix available even though this was reported x days ago.<br /><br />	I have verified that revert just that change fixes the issue.<br /><br />and just make the "because it breaks abc" be specific and clear enough <br />that I go "Ahh, ok, I'd better revert it".<br /><br />Also, please notice the latter part of the suggestion above: even if <br />somebody has bisected down their problem to a specific commit, I really <br />*do* want to hear that actually undoing the commit on top of the current <br />tree acually fixes it again, because sometimes that just isn't the case - <br />sometimes you end up having various interactions that means that reverting <br />a commit might simply not even work.<br /><br />I have no trouble at all with reverting commits in general. I think <br />regressions are serious.<br /><br />So the problematic cases are the cases where:<br /><br /> - the commit no longer reverts cleanly, or just otherwise introduces <br />   other infrastructure that other commits that already got merged depend <br />   on.<br /><br />   So sometimes you actually need a patch along with the revert (Andrew <br />   does that kind of thing anyway, since he works with patches regardless, <br />   so the "needs a patch" case is obviously not limited to just the <br />   problem cases)<br /><br /> - more commonly: it's not entirely clear which commit actually caused the <br />   problem.<br /><br />but I *do* want to encourage people to revert (and ask other people to <br />revert) much more aggressively. I personally try to revert things that <br />people report regressions to me about very actively, unless I know <br />somebody already has or is working on a fix.<br /><br />				Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
