I wish I could point you to the exact patch containing the <br />&gt; fix, but the git software seems to have lost track of it (it's combined<br />&gt; in with a large number of other patches with no obvious way to separate <br />&gt; it out).  It's also available in the various mailing list archives, but <br />&gt; I don't have a pointer to it and there's no reasonable way to search <br />&gt; for it.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; The patch in question was written by Matthew Wilcox; it added code to <br />&gt; the SCSI async-scanning routines to utilize the scan_mutex.  IMO it <br />&gt; should have been applied to 2.6.23 but it wasn't.<br /><br />Heh. It definitely hasn't gotten lost by "the git software". In fact, with <br />the kinds of hints you already gave, git makes it really _trivial_ to find <br />it.<br /><br />Here's what you do:<br /><br />	git log v2.6.23.. --author=Wilcox<br /><br />and then just search for "scan_mutex", in the hope that Matthew wrote a <br />nice commit message. And yes, he did, so in less than a blink you get:<br /><br />	commit 6b7f123f378743d739377871c0cbfbaf28c7d25a<br />	Author: Matthew Wilcox &lt;matthew&#64;wil.cx&gt;<br />	Date:   Tue Jun 26 15:18:51 2007 -0600<br /><br />	    [SCSI] Fix async scanning double-add problems<br /><br />	    Stress-testing and some thought has revealed some places where<br />	    asynchronous scanning needs some more attention to locking.<br /><br />	     - Since async_scan is a bit, we need to hold the host_lock while<br />	       modifying it to prevent races against other CPUs modifying the word<br />	       that bit is in.  This is probably a theoretical race for the moment,<br />	       but other patches may change that.<br />	     - The async_scan bit means not only that this host is being scanned<br />	       asynchronously, but that all the devices attached to this host are not<br />	       yet added to sysfs.  So we must ensure that this bit is always in sync.<br />	       I've chosen to do this with the scan_mutex since it's already acquired<br />	       in most of the right places.<br />		...<br /><br />which I assume is the commit you're talking about.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
