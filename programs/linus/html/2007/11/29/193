And, between the buggy file system implementation,<br />&gt; the intrusion on workflow, and the lack of scalability, at least in<br />&gt; the organization I worked for, it turned out to be a horrible,<br />&gt; horrible, horrible idea.<br /><br />Doing a read-only mount setup tends to be pretty easy, but it's largely <br />pointless except for specialty uses. Ie it's obviously not useful for <br />actual *development*, but it can be useful for some other cases.<br /><br />For example, a read-only revctrl filesystem can be a _very_ useful thing <br />for test-farms, where you may have hundreds of clients that run tests on <br />possibly different versions at the same time. In situations like that, the <br />read-only mount can actually often be done as a user-space NFS server on <br />some machine.<br /><br />The advantage is that you don't need to export close to infinite amounts <br />of versions from a "real" filesystem, or make the clients have their own <br />copies. And if you do it as a user-space NFS server (or samba, for that <br />matter), it's even portable, unlike many other approaches. The read-only <br />part also makes 99% of all the complexity go away, and it turns out to be <br />a fairly easy exercise to do.<br /><br />So I don't think the filesystem approach is _wrong_ per se. But yes, doing <br />it read-write is almost invariably a big mistake. On operatign systems <br />that support a "union mount" approach, it's likely much better to have a <br />read-only revctl thing, and then over-mount a regular filesystem on top of <br />it.<br /><br />Trying to make it read-write from the revctl engine standpoint is almost <br />certainly totally insane.<br /><br />				Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
