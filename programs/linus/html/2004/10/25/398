You are.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I think you're making it yourself way too easy.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Blaming Andrea for this mess is of course easy, but it doesn't solve <br />&gt; anything and misses the point<br /><br />[ Answering these in a different order ]<br /><br />The only thing I blame Andrea for is _whining_. Don't get me wrong, I <br />don't blame him for the bad state of CVS or anything like that.<br /><br />The fact is, Andrea doesn't actually do anything constructive when it <br />comes to SCM. He just complains every time somebody says something <br />positive about a product that (a) he didn't do anything for and (b) nobody <br />forces him to use, and (c) there are no real alternatives for today (much <br />less the three years ago he was whining about).<br /><br />&gt; The ability to handle big amounts of patches includes also the<br />&gt; possibility to merge a lot of crap. What keeps up the general quality?<br /><br />No SCM is _ever_ going to be a quality manager.<br /><br />And I also claim that people who think that "processes" are quality <br />management (see iso9000, or Dilbert) are seriously mistaken too.<br /><br />The thing that keeps up the general quality is _people_. Good people, who <br />take pride in the quality. They end up being maintainers, not because they <br />chose the job, but because people ended up chosing them, for better of for <br />worse.<br /><br />And the way to help those people is to make the day-to-day job easy, so<br />that they can spend as much time as possible on the thing that matters:  <br />upholding good taste (and in the process keeping quality up). And that's<br />where an SCM comes in - not as a primary source of quality, but as a way<br />to keep track of the details, so that people can concentrate on what is<br />important.<br /><br />And the SCM doesn't have to be anything really fancy. It can be a few <br />scripts to keep track of patches (that tends to grow and become slightly <br />more sophisticated over time). I'm not saying that BK is "it". There's a <br />number of BK users there, but clearly there are other ways to maintain <br />patches too - and people use them.<br /><br />But complaining when a maintainer uses a tool that suits him is _stupid_. <br />It's arrogant to think that you can tell me how to do my work, but it's <br />really stupid when you can't give any reasonable alternatives that would <br />help me do it as efficiently.<br /><br />And that's what Andrea is doing. Sure, BK is commercial, but dammit, so is<br />that 2GHz dual-G5 too and that Shuttle box in my corner. They happen to be<br />the tools I use for what I do. If Andrea told me that I should use a<br />slower machine because that's what most people use, I'd consider him a<br />total idiot. Similarly, when he complains that people use software tools<br />that clearly _do_ make them more productive, I consider his complaint<br />stupid.<br /><br />There are other tools I use to make myself more productive. Many of them<br />are open source. Some I wrote myself. But I still use "uemacs" and "pine"  <br />as part of my tool-chest, for example - and last I saw, they weren't open<br />source either (but I hear that the uemacs author stopped caring, so that<br />one might have been re-licensed).<br /><br />Should I (or anybody else) ask Andrea's permission before we start using <br />non-opensource tools? No.  If Andrea were complaining about my "pine" <br />usage, he'd be laughed off the planet. It may be ass-backwards and old and <br />text-only, but the fact is, it's really none of his damn business, even <br />though he can see the effects in every email I write in the headers.<br /><br />Similarly, Andrea can see some of the effects of me using BK when he looks<br />at the tar-balls and patches - syntactic markers that show that they have<br />been generated by a person who uses BK. It's really _no_ different from<br />the fact that I use pine to communicate. And no, neither BK nor pine are<br />under an open source license.  Deal with it.<br /><br />Can Andrea point me to open-source tools and ask me politely whether I've <br />considered them as alternatives? Hell yes. I encourage him to do so when <br />something appears.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
