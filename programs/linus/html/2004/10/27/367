Dream on. My personal<br />source tree is on my own machine, nobody touches it but me. That's how I<br />have _always_ worked. The public ones are just random other repositories, <br />they get pushed to by me and nobody else.<br /><br />And I mean that "nobody else". If somebody else tried to push something<br />else than what is in my tree into them, I'd notice, because of how BK<br />works. My pushes just wouldn't _work_.<br /><br />And you get a lot more data out of the kernel repostitory than you got<br />_before_ I was using BK, in a much more timely manner - even if you're not <br />a BK user. You get tar-balls and patches every night, something that just <br />wouldn't happen without a SCM that I liked.<br /><br />&gt; Give me a good reason, why he can deny me that rather simple request to <br />&gt; get some data out of the repository.<br /><br />Give me _one_ good reason you think you have the right to anything more?<br /><br />The alternative to me using BitKeeper would be patches and tar-balls. <br />Which you already have. So why are you complaining? BK isn't taking <br />anything away from you.. <br /><br />Since you seem to be blind to the problem, let's try it one more time. <br /><br />The BK license is _exactly_ the same issue as with the GPL. In the GPL, <br />the rule is "tit for tat" - you get to play with the sources, but in <br />exchange you have to give out your modifications. Some people complain <br />about that, and I call them worthless whiners.<br /><br />In the BK license, it's "tit for tat". You get to use Larry's program, in <br />exchange for not competing with him. Some people complain about that, and <br />I call them worthless whiners.<br /><br />See the pattern? In both cases, the answer is: if you don't like it, don't <br />use it. And in both cases, if you don't use it, you are no worse off than <br />if it didn't exists, so it's not like the existence of GPL'd programs or <br />BK is making your life any worse.<br /><br />Sure, your life could be better if you accepted the rules. But that's the <br />whole POINT of the rules. That's why the GPL works - people accept the <br />fact that they have to make modifications available, because they think <br />that it's worth it for them. Same is true of the BK users - they accept <br />the license because they think it's worth it for them.<br /><br />Or they don't. Their (your) choice. Don't whine to me or to Larry. It's<br />_your_ problem, and it is for _you_ to solve.
