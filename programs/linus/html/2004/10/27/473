Is the massively reduced data set in the cvs repository <br />&gt; really all we ever get out of it again?<br /><br />Roman, I'm not going to bother fighing your idiotic issues any more.<br /><br />The data is all there, and has been there since day one. That's what the <br />patches are, that's what the tar-balls I do are, and that's what the <br />snapshots that others do are.<br /><br />All there.

And I do.<br /><br />What's so hard to understand with the single sentence:<br /><br />	"Don't complain about other peoples licenses."<br /><br />And no, it has _nothing_ to do with the GPL vs BK. It's a general truism.  <br />The fact is, developers can choose whatever license they want for their<br />own code. And users can choose whatever program they want, as long as they<br />follow that license. And it's _their_ decisions.<br /><br />&gt; I don't care what tools you use, I don't care if I can't use them, but<br />&gt; why is it acceptable for you to cut off _any_ possibility for me to<br />&gt; archive the same result in some other way?<br /><br />But I don't. If you don't like BK, use the tar-balls. It's exactly the <br />same source tree.<br /><br />And no, if you don't use BK, you can't use the BK tree. Well DUH! <br /><br />And if you want to go write your own SCM, and use your own SCM for doing <br />your own Linux development, be my guest. But stop whining about choices <br />that OTHER people made, and that you don't have anything to do with.<br /><br />As it is, you're nothing but an uninvited religious nut at my door, trying<br />to convince me on your nut-case religion.
