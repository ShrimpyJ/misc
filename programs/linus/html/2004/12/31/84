Basically Linus patch does a nice cleanup plus POPF <br />&gt; handling, so maybe the patch can be split.<br /><br />The popf part is very nice in that it allows you to single-step and debug <br />this thing.<br /><br />The fact is, I can't debug Wine. The code-base is just too alien for me, <br />so to debug this thing I needed to come up with a silly example of TF <br />usage, and try to debug _that_ instead as if it were something unknown (ie <br />debugging by knowing what the program does is a no-no, since that would <br />have defeated the whole exercise).<br /><br />And handlign "popf" correctly really was the only sane way to debug it, <br />anything else would never have worked in a real-life debugging situation. <br />It's easy enough to say "well, just do it by hand", but that's not <br />practical when you debug with "si 1000" to try to pinpoint the behaviour a <br />bit.<br /><br />And clearly my debuggability exercise seem to have worked, since the end<br />result apparently ended up doing the right thing for Wine.<br /><br />This is why debuggability is important. I realize that people may think <br />I'm inconsistent (since I abhor kernel debuggers), but while _I_ abhor <br />debuggers, I also think that the primary objective of an operating system <br />is to make easy things easy, and hard things possible, so while I don't <br />much like debuggers, I consider it a fundamental failure if the kernel <br />doesn't have proper support for them.<br /><br />So I think it's worth splitting out the "popf" part of the patch, but even<br />if that one doesn't actually matter for Warcraft, I'd put it in just so <br />that we have a state where we're _supposed_ to be able to debug things <br />with TF in them. Just having the mental expectation that things like that <br />should work is important - otherwise we'll eventually end up having some <br />other subtle problem with TF handling.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
