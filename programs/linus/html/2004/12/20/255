I think that much more important than the patch is the fact that <br />people get used to the notion that they can change the kernel - not just <br />on an intellectual level ("I understand that the GPL means that I have the <br />right to change my kernel"), but on a more practical level ("Hey, I did <br />that small change").<br /><br />And whether it ends up being the right thing or not, that's how everybody<br />starts out. It's simply not possible to "get into" the kernel without<br />starting out small, and making mistakes. So I very much encourage it, even<br />if I often don't have the time to actually worry about small patches, and <br />I try to get suckers^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hother developers like Rusty to try to <br />acts as quality control and a "gathering place".<br /><br />Btw, this is why even "trivial patches" really do take time - they often <br />have trivial mistakes in them, and it's not just because there are more <br />inexperienced people doing them - most of _my_ mistakes tend to be at the <br />truly idiotic level, just because it "looked obvious", and then there's <br />something that I miss.<br /><br />So at one level I absolutely _hate_ trivial patches: they take time and <br />effort to merge, and individually the patch itself is often not really <br />obviously "worth it". But at the same time, I think the trivial patches <br />are among the most important ones - exactly because they are the "entry" <br />patches for every new developer.<br /><br />I just try really hard to find somebody else to worry about them ;)<br /><br />(It's not a thankful job, btw, exactly because it _looks_ so trivial. It's<br />easy to point to 99 patches that are absolutely obvious, and complain<br />about the fact that they haven't been merged. But they take time to merge<br />exactly because of that one patch that _did_ look obvious, but wasn't.  <br />And actually, it's usually not 99:1, it's usually more like 10:1 or<br />something).<br /><br />So please don't stop. Yes, those trivial patches _are_ a bother. Damn, <br />they are _horrible_. But at the same time, the devil is in the detail, and <br />they are needed in the long run. Both the patches themselves, and the <br />people that grew up on them.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
