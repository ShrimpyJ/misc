Step back a bit. Stop this idiocy about thinking that this is all <br />about you, and all about your reiser4 "metas" etc.<br /><br />This is about VFS interfaces, and about being generic and _useful_.<br /><br />Quite frankly, there is absolutely _zero_ point to make attributes just <br />because reiser4 can implement them. Zero. Nada. Zilch. It just won't <br />matter, because people are NOT GOING TO SWITCH TO REISER4 IN MASS.<br /><br />So in order to make this useful, it has to be:<br /> - stable. This means that if Al Viro asks about locking and aliasing<br />   issues, you don't ignore it, you ask "how high?"<br /> - portable. Preferably across operating systems, but at the very _least_ <br />   across filesystems. See the NFSv4 thing, for example.<br /> - useful to the people who would actually use it. Right now that's samba, <br />   and not a whole lot else.  For everybody else, the pain of not having <br />   _all_ major filesystems support it is probably so insurmountable that<br />   it's just not going to happen.<br /><br />Do you get it? If you can't get your mind out of your little current <br />reiser4 issues, don't even bother talking about it.<br /><br />Look through the thread on "possible design issues for hybrids" for me<br />actually talking with Al on how to handle problem #1. That's one important<br />thing, and in fact, that one is important whether we expose it to a normal<br />"open()" call or not, since all the same aliasing issues exist<br />_regardless_ of interfaces.<br /><br />"openat()" happens to be _one_ solution to #2 and #3. You haven't given <br />any constructive input to _any_ of the problems, and you keep on raising <br />totally irrelevant issues. Face the music, Hans. If you can't solve those <br />three problems, whatever you do simply DOES NOT MATTER.<br /><br />In particular, in the two last emails to you, I tried to show that<br />"openat()" is _independent_ of streams/attributes. That it has semantics<br />that have absolutely _nothing_ to do with metas. And in BOTH CASES you<br />could not wrap your brain around that fact, and kept on harping about<br />meta's.<br /><br />There are bigger issues here. I'm perfectly happy to _also_ expose the<br />streams as regular filenames, but I've tried to explain that that doesn't<br />work for directories, for example, so YOU CANNOT -JUST- talk about the<br />filename-only thing. You do need to have a different namespace.  Full<br />stop. What's so hard to understand about that?<br /><br />So stop ignoring the issues. Stop ignoring the fact that not everything <br />revolves around how you happened to implement something.
