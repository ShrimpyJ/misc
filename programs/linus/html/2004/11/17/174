(A comment in the code for each one would<br />&gt; be rather messy)<br /><br />It really doesn't help with a single person, since any code you wrote you <br />can do anything with _anyway_ (ie you're not even bound by the GPL at all, <br />since you can re-license it under whatever license you want). So naming <br />people really doesn't help anybody, while naming _files_ does (because <br />then _others_ than you can decide to relicense based on that file).<br /><br />See what I'm saying? You as the author always have full rights, which is <br />why the "v2 or later" really needs to be attached to _code_, not to a <br />person. You may know the code you wrote, but very few other people will. <br /><br />Also, attaching it to the code is the only way to have places with <br />multiple developers (and let's face it, these days that's pretty much <br />every corner of the kernel) to note the "compunded" rules. <br /><br />&gt; It might be a good idea to figure out how to have a list of contributors<br />&gt; who've said that or "v2 - or if Linus Torvalds so chooses, a later<br />&gt; version"<br /><br />Yes, modulo again the fact that I really don't think it's about people but<br />about files. Not just because of the argument above, either: some people<br />might really do licensing per file: I've done it myself (ie I allowed my<br />original stupid math emulator to be relicenced under the BSD license, even<br />though I would not do that for other things). Also, I'd be willing to do <br />the "v2 or later" on my code if somebody else has been working on it a lot <br />and feels strongly about it, even though I do not in _general_ tend to <br />agree with a carte blanche for the FSF to make up any random license.<br /><br />For all we know, GPL v3 will really be a good license, and everybody will<br />agree that we want to upgrade. I just don't _know_, and I'm not willing to <br />just take something that important on trust.<br /><br />&gt; &gt; Note the "IF". Linux _never_ had the "v2 or later" clause, so that "if" <br />&gt; &gt; was never an issue, and the clarification on top of the COPYING file <br />&gt; &gt; really _is_ just a clarification.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Correction noted. I went and checked 1.2.0 and indeed it says nothing<br />&gt; about versions in that specific top level file.<br /><br />Indeed. There are a lot of files that _do_ have the boilerplate thing, but<br />those obviously aren't in question (although iirc last time when this<br />detail came up and I pointed out what the real rules wrt that "v2 or<br />later" were, some people actually _removed_ their thing too, so the<br />confusion about these things and the preferences can obviously go either<br />way).<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
