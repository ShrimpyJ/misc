As long as the kernel<br />&gt; &gt;&gt; doesn't recognize that an ABI is a contract, rather than an<br />&gt; &gt;&gt; imposition, kernel developers won't care.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; &gt; That's a silly analogy. Worse, it's a very flawed analogy.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; &gt; If you want to use a legal analogy, the ABI is not a contract, it's a<br />&gt; &gt; public _license_.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I didn't mean to use a legal analogy.  I meant contract in the<br />&gt; software engineering sense.  Sorry if that wasn't clear.<br /><br />Then your definition of a "contract" is flawed or your world-view has <br />nothing to do with reality.<br /><br />An ABI is not a contract. It's somebody exposing a certain set of <br />features. It does _not_ mean that the party that gets exposed has any say <br />wrt the features. At most he can hope that the exported set doesn't <br />shrink or change semantically, but let's face it, even that does happen.<br /><br />The Linux kernel has been very very good about this exposure, in the sense <br />that we try very very hard not to break it. I think that's a good thing. <br />But that in no way makes anything a "contract".<br /><br />It's the same thing with CPU vendors. You as a programmer, didn't get to <br />dictate what the CPU vendor implemented. You take it or leave it, and at <br />most you can make suggestions about things that might make the CPU vendor <br />sell more chips. The ISA is not a "contract" - it's just an interface that <br />was handed down to you. You didn't get to negotiate, you got to say "yes" <br />or "no".<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
