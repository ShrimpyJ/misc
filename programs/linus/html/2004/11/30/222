Not a "let's move it all there and then prune it". <br /><br />Leave anything questionable in the current location. And never EVER move <br />anything that is kernel-internal to a new "clean" tree, because that would <br />be totally pointless. At that point, people would have to edit the "clean" <br />tree even for kernel internal stuff. No go.<br /><br />Also, "ukabi" just isn't going to fly as a name. It's also not as simple <br />as you seem to think, since a lot of these ABI things are architecture- <br />dependent, which apparently all you guys have totally ignored. <br /><br />I've suggested "include/user/" and "include/asm-xxx/user", which handles <br />architecture-specific parts too. I'm ok with doing it the other way <br />around, ie "include/user/" and "include/user/arch-xxxx".<br /><br />And "user" might be "user-abi" or something like that, but it sure isn't <br />going to be some unreadable contraction.<br /><br />And I _still_ want to see these patches only for things where somebody can <br />validly argue that <br /> (a) it can't break anything (ie the old location still includes the new <br />     one, exactly the same way)<br /> (b) there are people who will actually take _advantage_ of that <br />     particular file (ie "just because I think so" doesn't fly).<br /><br />Moving files around is just too disruptive to be done without damn good <br />reason.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
