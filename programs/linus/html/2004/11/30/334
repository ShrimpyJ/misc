It's a cleanup. It goes under the same rules<br />&gt; &gt; a spelling fix does.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; So you don't see a long-term technical benefit in cleaning up the<br />&gt; API/ABI we export to userspace so that userspace stops depending on<br />&gt; stuff which just isn't supposed to be there?<br /><br />I see _benefits_, but exactly because they aren't immediate, I think we <br />should be careful.<br /><br />Also, exactly because moving things around is a total _nightmare_ from a <br />diff and source maintenance perspective, we should be _extra_ careful. <br />It's almost impossible to see something that changed when that something <br />is _also_ being moved around. You don't see it in the diff, and you don't <br />see it in any of the tools - a small semantic change that would have been <br />absolutely OBVIOUS if it was in a regular diff gets totally drowned out by <br />the "move" diff. <br /><br />Put another way: when people do things like re-indenting a driver (which <br />has _exactly_ the same issues: cleanup for the future, but totally <br />destroys all chance of seeing what the changes actually were), I want the <br />patch that does the re-indentation to be totally independent of the actual <br />changes.<br /><br />Ie we do one patch that _only_ does the whitespace changes, and try to <br />make sure that it doesn't break anything even by mistake. People even <br />compile the thing and verify that it is 100% the same thing as an object <br />file. Then that gets applied. Only _after_ that should you make changes.<br /><br />Do we follow this religiously? For small things, clearly no. We sometimes <br />mix whitespace and real changes. But we sure as hell shouldn't. At least <br />not for anything bigger.<br /><br />The EXACT same thing is true of any header file movement. DO NOT CHANGE <br />SEMANTICS WHEN YOU MOVE STUFF!<br /><br />It's not just my personal hangup. It's a damn good idea.<br /><br />I will hereby just ignore this thread. Please remove me from the Cc, I've <br />wasted way too much time on this total idiocy already. I've made my <br />opinions extremely clear, and quite frankly, I don't want to hear anything <br />on this any more for at least a week.
