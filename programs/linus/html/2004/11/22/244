So the "since June" is clearly true only in a very limited <br />sense.<br /><br />A more correct way to say it would be that within hours of releasing a<br />test-kernel (not even a real release) that _really_ disabled the links, we<br />got people reporting boot failures.<br /><br />&gt; and clearing the entire ELCR, and then re-enabling them both only as we<br />&gt; use them causes a failure.<br /><br />Now, the clearing the entire ELCR thing has been tested by all of three <br />people, all of whom saw problems with the non-clearing thing. So not only <br />is the base for that claim very thin indeed, the small base was totally <br />self-selected, ie statistically completely meaningless even if it had <br />been much much larger.<br /><br />Nobody who didn't actually see the problem in the first place would have <br />tested it.<br /><br />IOW, I'll claim that the only thing that has really gotten testing since <br />June is the thing that disables and immediately re-enables the links.<br /><br />And that's exactly why I think the "minimally disruptive" fix is to not<br />disable them at all, but just fix up ELCR for anything that was already<br />enabled. Since that _is_ what "disable + re-enable" ends up actually<br />doing.<br /><br />See my argument?<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
