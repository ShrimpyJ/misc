Please understand, however, that the legacy device<br />&gt; drivers _are_ broken.  The BIOS via ACPI clearly tells them if the<br />&gt; devices are present or not, and Linux isn't yet listening.<br /><br />I really disagree.<br /><br />I realize that you like ACPI, or you would have shot yourself long long <br />ago.<br /><br />But I have a totally different view on things. To me, firmware is not <br />something cool to be used. It's a necessary evil, and it should be avoided <br />and mistrusted as far as humanly possible, because it is always buggy, and <br />we can't fix the bugs in it.<br /><br />Yes, the current ACPI layer in the kernel is a lot better at working<br />around the bugs, and it's getting to the point where I suspect Linux<br />vendors actually decide that enabing ACPI by default causes fewer problems <br />than it solves. That clearly didn't use to be true.<br /><br />&gt; ACPI-compliant systems have three types of interrupts:<br /><br />Stop right there. <br /><br />"ACPI-compliant systems". The fact is, there is no such thing. There are <br />systems that users buy, and they are not "ACPI compliant", they are "one <br />implementation of ACPI that was tested with a single vendor usage test".<br /><br />Call me cynical, but I believe in standards papers just about as much as I <br />believe in the voices in my attic that tell me to kill the Queen of <br />England. <br /><br />Papers is so much dead trees. The only thing that matters is real life.  <br />And like it or not, real life does NOT implement standards properly, even<br />if the standards are well written and unambiguous (which also doesn't<br />actually happen in real life).<br /><br />&gt; If somebody bolts motherboard hardware on and doesn't tell ACPI about<br />&gt; it, then they need to disable ACPI, which _owns_ configuration of<br />&gt; motherboard devices when it is enabled.<br /><br />No. The only thing that owns the motherboard is the user. ACPI shouldn't <br />get uppity.<br /><br />&gt; The damn good reason is that doing otherwise breaks systems.<br /><br />And not doing it breaks systems.<br /><br />See a pattern?<br /><br />This is why I don't trust firmware. It's always buggy. <br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
