Not only that. st_blocks is a UNIX standard, it's not<br />&gt; in POSIX. I always try to keep the core fileserving code as<br />&gt; close to POSIX as possible to allow people to do crazy things<br />&gt; (like porting it to Windows :-).<br /><br />Ehh, what's the problem with just having a simple config flag, and just <br />export whatever the underlying server exports. At least it won't be the <br />total mess that samba clearly makes of it now.<br /><br />You cannot claim that the number samba now puts there makes _any_ sense.  <br />Why the apparent 1MB minimum limit? And if it's just the size of the file<br />in bytes, then why bother with it at all? And if you cannot get a <br />blocksize from the OS, why make up a nonsensical number?<br /><br />In other words, your arguments do not make any sense. <br /><br />Let's go through this:<br /><br /> - you argue that you can't depend on st_blocks. <br /><br />   This implies that _any_ number you use for "number of bytes" _or_ <br />   "number of blocks" used on disk has _zero_ to do with reality.<br /><br />   This implies that the whole exercise is pointless, and you shouldn't <br />   fill in the value at all.<br /><br /> - assuming you _do_ look at st_blocks on the server, you argue that you <br />   cannot make sense of it.<br /><br />   Ok, so there may be broken systems out there. Tough. If you can't make <br />   sense of the number, why are you trying to export it again?<br /><br />In other words, neither of your arguments make any sense. You'd be better <br />off just initializing the field with plain zero, and not lying to the <br />client with a number that has no relevance to anything at all, and expect <br />the client to sort it out.<br /><br />My argument is that if the only thing the client can really use the <br />information for is st_blocks (or equivalent) _anyway_, then just export <br />it. And if you think<br /><br />		unsigned long st_blocks = 0;<br /><br />	#ifdef HOST_HAS_ST_BLOCKS<br />		st_blocks = stat-&gt;st_blocks;<br />	#endif<br /><br />is too ugly yo have in a header file somewhere, then why bother with <br />trying to put any number in there in the first place? What was the point <br />of:<br /><br />	CIFS Extensions for UNIX systems V1<br />	LARGE_INTEGER NumOfBlocks<br />	Number of file system block used to store file<br /><br />again?  Was it a CIFS Extension for POSIX? Or was it for UNIX like the <br />documentation specifies? Was it bytes, or was it blocks, like the <br />documentation says?<br /><br />Methinks you've been looking too much at what MS does over the wire, and <br />that has made you think that it makes total sense to send random numbers <br />over the wire. Maybe so - maybe it's how you have to think if you make a <br />samba server. But if so, just _say_ so, instead of making arguments that <br />make no sense.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
