When you use "stat()", and you look <br />at "st_blocks", it's ALWAYS in 512-byte entities. It doesn't matter that <br />"st_blksize" might be something else - when UNIX counts blocks, it counts <br />them in 512-byte chunks.<br /><br />So complaining that you don't have a blocksize is just silly.<br /><br />This is a fairly common thinko, btw. Many people see "st_blocks" and<br />"st_blksize" in the UNIX stat info, and they think that they are defined<br />in terms of each other, and that disk usage is "st_blocks*st_blksize"  <br />bytes. Not so. Disk usage is "st_blocks*512" bytes, and "st_blksize" is<br />something totally different - it's the _preferred_ IO blocking factor.<br /><br />So let's all repeat after me: UNIX file "blocksize" is 512. It's not a<br />question of whether that value makes sense these days or not, it's just a<br />matter of simple _fact_.<br /><br />&gt; Some conservative way of correcting it is the following:<br /><br />Since that won't fix "du" _anyway_, I think it's pointless. As you point <br />out:<br /><br />&gt; Now another trouble is that samba people also use a minimum of 1Mo<br />&gt; (hence the number in the above fstat result). I'm not sure what to do<br />&gt; with this: should we then use file size which we divide into sectors<br />&gt; ourselves ? Or should we keep 1Mo, getting some strange results to some<br />&gt; extent ?<br /><br />I'm claiming that samba is broken, and we should not try to fix it on the<br />client side.  We should ask the samba people to get their act together.  <br />They've apparently been able to put _two_ bugs in one single integer:  <br />both messing up the block size _and_ then using a totally illogical<br />minimum value for the thing.<br /><br />I bet the minimum value comes from the fact that all files end up using <br />"n" bytes for things like inodes etc. Let's make up some numbers, and <br />assume that somebody thought that the minimum disk-space used was 2kB. <br />Instead of dividing that by 512, and coming up with the value "4", they <br />multiplied it by the block size and came up with the value 1Mb.<br /><br />Whatever the reason, the minimum size is clearly a samba bug, even if you <br />were to (incorrectly, Jeremy) claim that there is no standard blocksize.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
