This way  we'd prevent<br />&gt; stupid people from doing stupid things.<br /><br />Hey, the thing is, that may well prevent smart people from doing smart <br />things too. Give 'em rope, within reason.<br /><br />The point behind __force is not so much that you should never use it, but <br />that you should never use it by _mistake_. It's very easy (and often <br />_required_) to have a regular typecast in C, and it can often hide bugs <br />when you cast something in a way that you didn't really think through.<br /><br />For example, we often have generic "void *" or "unsigned long" things that<br />are used for passing opaque data around, and they need casts when working<br />with them. It is quite conceivable that you need an address space cast<br />too, and that you need to use "__force" to do so. It might be ok, even in<br />a driver. But hopefully it's something where the action of having to force <br />the cast makes people think about it more. And the fact that there <br />probably never will be very _man_ casts like that means that they'll stand <br />out.<br /><br />If people start using "__force" to hide their own bugs, we'll just have to <br />start stringing them up. Hang'em high, I say.
