Why should anything like this be considered<br />acceptable?<br /><br />I'm going to pull it this once, because let's face it, nobody sane<br />cares about that idiotic driver to begin with (and it does remove a<br />lot more lines than it adds). But really, if I see something like that<br />again, I will just tell you to go away and not send me crap like this<br />again.<br /><br />If it's that kind of crap, it should go into staging, or it shouldn't<br />have been merged into the kernel in the first place.<br /><br />Seriously. You need to start showing better taste. I realize that most<br />of SCSI is crazy specialty hardware that is used by just a few people,<br />but if you don't start pushing back on those vendors and make them do<br />proper changes in small pieces and with actual commentary, then _I_ am<br />going to push back at you. Hard. By simply not pulling crap.<br /><br />This is not the first time I've been disgusted with the SCSI tree. And<br />quite frankly, drivers like BFA are so totally irrelevant to anything,<br />that I will have absolutely no problems with just saying "screw it, if<br />they can't behave, they get removed from the kernel".<br /><br />And don't blame it on bad vendors that won't do a good job. If they<br />don't do a good job, then STOP TAKING THEIR CRAP. Make them understand<br />that they need to work with the process, not do some kind of random<br />"change everything, with no actual explanations". Blame me if you<br />can't grow the balls to stand up to them. Tell them that I simply<br />won't take it unless they clean up their act.<br /><br />Because I really won't.<br /><br />                        Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
