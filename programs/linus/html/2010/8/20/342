Doing this<br />&gt; check is currently too expensive because of the need to use<br />&gt; find_vma_prev. Is that right?<br /><br />Exactly.<br /><br />&gt; It does look like a big task, but if it seems like the only sane option<br />&gt; I'll take a look at it and see if can be broken down into manageable<br />&gt; stages.<br /><br />It should be a pretty straightforward search-and-replace. And almost<br />all of it would be real cleanups.<br /><br />And it would be trivial to change the loops like<br /><br />    for (vma = mm-&gt;mmap; vma; vma = vma-&gt;vm_next)<br /><br />into basically just<br /><br />   list_for_each_entry(vma, &amp;mm-&gt;mmap, vm_list)<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />&gt; You mentioned making this a tunable in your original commit message,<br />&gt; that would at least help in the short term so I may look into that too.<br />&gt; (prctl would be the right interface?)<br /><br />I'm not convinced a tunable is really the right thing, but in this<br />case it might be acceptable, since you really are doing something<br />rather specific and odd. Changing the VM to use doubly-linked lists<br />would be a lot _cleaner_, though.<br /><br />&gt; I wonder if there's any way to auto tune, for example automatically<br />&gt; disabling the guard page for a process which mlocks only part of its<br />&gt; stack VMA. That would obviously target the specific issue I'm seeing<br />&gt; pretty directly and would only reopen the hole for applications which<br />&gt; were already doing odd things (c.f. your earlier comment about the guard<br />&gt; page not being magic or helping with wilfully crazy userspace).<br /><br />I'd really hate to try to do something subtle that doesn't have<br />obvious semantics. Subtle code is buggy code. Maybe not today, but two<br />years from now..<br /><br />                     Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
