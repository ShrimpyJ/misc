Or it<br />&gt; would make sense to employ a converter from XXX to input (either purely<br />&gt; in-kernel or userspace over uinput)?<br /><br />Umm... You've brought that up before as an objection, but what _is_<br />that other model that you would convert from? IOW what *is* that XXX<br />that you talk about?<br /><br />So I think accelerometers etc should be seen as input devices for the<br />simple reason that<br /><br /> (a) They really *are* input devices in all the most common cases. If<br />you have a phone with an accelerometer, it really is used as an input<br />device quite like a joystick.<br /><br />The fact that there are specialized and rare cases where people may<br />have some fancier accelerometer that isn't necessarily seen that way,<br />and where it is used for some fancy scientific experiment or whatever<br />doesn't change this in *any* way. The common case that almost<br />everybody cares about - and that is getting more common - is the<br />simple and obvious input case.<br /><br />How is a Wii accelerometer in any way different from a joystick? How<br />is a phone accelerometer any different from one? The answer is clear:<br />they aren't different! So it makes 100% sense to expose them under the<br />same subsystem.<br /><br />(b) You cannot even name your XXX thing. It clearly makes sense (at<br />least within Tue context of a driver for some embedded phone chip) to<br />see it as an input device. And nothing else comes to mind. You'd have<br />to expose it as some random character device and then everybody would<br />just have to make it emulate an input device in user space anyway.<br />What's the point of that?<br /><br />None. That's what the point is.<br /><br />So I really don't understand why you're fighting the input device<br />angle. It makes sense as an input device. It does NOT make sense as<br />anything else.<br /><br />Really - what else could a phone accelerometer (or GPS device, for<br />that matter) really be? It very much is about user input - even if it<br />isn't a keyboard.<br /><br />            Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
