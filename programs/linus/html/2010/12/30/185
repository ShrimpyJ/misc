The code is really confused, and seems to mix up<br />"lvds_use_ssc" not just with the enabling of SSC, but it also with how<br />impacts the reference clock itself.<br /><br />And it impacts the reference clock in really odd ways, that look buggy<br />and confusing, where the tests are repeated in multiple places: first<br />to set the reference frequency, and then later to set the bits that<br />choose the reference input frequency.<br /><br />In particular, look at how 'refclk' is calculated in<br />intel_crtc_mode_set(), vs how we actually set the input frequency<br />later in the function. The two don't actually *match*. That sounds<br />bogus to me - since it means that the pll values have been calculated<br />for a reference clock that isn't actually used. No?<br /><br />Look at the code for the "!is_lvds" case, for example. It uses<br />"IS_GEN2()" to determine what refclk to use, but then when setting the<br />PLL_REF_INPUT_xyz bits, we actually take "is_tv" into account - which<br />the code didn't when it calculated refclk. That strikes me as odd. No?<br /><br />Now, that shouldn't matter for the LVDS case, but I'm wondering<br />whether something similar is going on where the conditionals just<br />don't match up, and we end up calculating the plls for a different<br />frequency than the one we actually end up _using_.<br /><br />There's also this very odd special refclock magic for ironlake<br />limiting that only happens for ssc_freq == 100 when ssc is enabled.<br />Maybe the problem is in the limiting tables, and the ssc frequency<br />change just ends up then picking the "wrong" limiter table? So even if<br />the frequency is correct, and the pll calculations are using that<br />correct frequency, the 120-vs-100Mhz frequency change ended up<br />switching the tables around?<br /><br />                               Linus<br />--<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
