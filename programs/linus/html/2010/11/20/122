Many machine checks _were_ software errors. They were things like<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; the BIOS not clearing some old pending state etc.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt; I think the BIOS error should be reported to hardware vendor instead<br />&gt;&gt; of software vendor. Do you think so?<br />&gt;<br />&gt; They won't care. The only people who care are _us_. Software people.<br />&gt; We may be able to work around a broken BIOS.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Also, sometimes the machine checks are really our fault. Read the<br />&gt; Intel documentation on page tables etc, it says that you can get<br />&gt; machine checks if you inconsistent page attributes. Or maybe that was<br />&gt; AMD.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; The point is, it's simply not _true_ that hardware errors are always a<br />&gt; hardware bug. It never has been.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; And it's not _true_ that people care about them the same way. The only<br />&gt; thing that is true is that a sysadmin wants to see them, but he wants<br />&gt; to see them _exactly_ the same way he wants to see a kernel oops etc.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;&gt;&gt; IT HAS NOTHING WHAT-SO-EVER TO DO WITH HOW OFTEN THE ERRORS HAPPEN.<br />&gt;&gt;<br />&gt;&gt; Because some external cause like cosmic rays and electromagnetic<br />&gt;&gt; interference can cause hardware errors too. We need error counting to<br />&gt;&gt; distinguish between external caused hardware errors and real hardware<br />&gt;&gt; errors.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Do you really think that a system administrator is too stupid to count to three?<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Yes, admittedly I've met some people like that. But no, "cosmic rays"<br />&gt; do not change anything.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; People have had this for _ages_ with simple parity-protected RAM (with<br />&gt; ECC just being another fancier form of it). People _know_.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; If you get an ECC report randomly once a month per machine, you know<br />&gt; it's something like cosmic rays.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; And if you notice that _one_ of your machines gets five ECC errors per<br />&gt; minute, you know it's something else. As an MIS person you might still<br />&gt; decide keep the dang thing, because it's just the print server for the<br />&gt; admin people, and you know that your paycheck is handled by another<br />&gt; machine. But if it's the Quake server, you realize that it needs to be<br />&gt; replaced _today_.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; See? That's not the kind of rational decision that some automated<br />&gt; program can make.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; It really is that simple. No amount of "automatic counting" will ever<br />&gt; help you. Quite the reverse. It will just complicate the thing.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;&gt; So, do you agree that we need some tool oriented interface in addition<br />&gt;&gt; to printk?<br />&gt;<br />&gt; No. Any such tool will just _hide_ the information from the MIS people<br />&gt; who don't even know about it.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; But you could certainly make a simple agreed-upon format. We have BUG:<br />&gt; and WARNING: in the kernel logs. Why not HWPROBLEM: or something?<br />&gt;<br />&gt; MIS people love their perl scripts. And the people who can't do perl<br />&gt; can still use the standard log tools.<br />&gt;<br />&gt;                               Linus<br />&gt;<br />--<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
