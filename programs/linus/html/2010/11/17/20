When you marked c9d66d35<br />as bad, that is literally _exactly_ v2.6.36-rc6 plus one mfd commit.<br />So if that kernel doesnt' boot for you, then neither will plain<br />2.6.36-rc6.<br /><br />I see a few possibilities:<br /><br /> - you somehow tested/booted the wrong kernels and thus marked things<br />"bad" when they weren't.<br /><br /> - 2.6.36-rc6 doesn't work either, so you started out saying it was<br />good even though it wasn't really. Everything after it is obviously<br />also broken, so you'll just end up with everything marked "bad", and<br />bisection will decide it must be the first commit after 2.6.36-rc6<br />(since that was marked "good").<br /><br /> - there's some bug that affects boot of the "next" kernel, and the<br />kernel you go back to in between has that problem.<br /><br /> - you switched compiler or other build tool in between things, so<br />back when you started, 2.6.36-rc6 was good, but then when you compiled<br />that same kernel with the trivial mfd thing on top, the build tool<br />change resulted in it no longer working - but not having anything to<br />do with the actual kernel sources in question.<br /><br />So double-check that 2.6.36-rc6 kernel.<br /><br />                 Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
