Why do we care about some special case that<br />(a) likely doesn't happen and (b) even if it happens, what's the<br />problem with it happening?<br /><br />Let me put it this way: the autogroup thing modifies the scheduler in<br />some subtle ways, but it doesn't make any _semantic_ difference. And<br />it's not like enabling/disabling autogroup scheduling is something<br />critical to begin with. It's a heuristic.<br /><br />THAT is why I think it's so silly to try to be so strict and walk over<br />all processes while holding a couple of spinlocks.<br /><br />Ok, so you disable autogroups after having used them, _and_ having<br />done some really specific things, and some processes that used to be<br />in a group may end up still scheduling in that group. Why care? It's<br />not like random people can enable/disable autogroup scheduling and try<br />to use this as a way to get unfair scheduling.<br /><br />In fact, I'd go as far as saying that for the tty-based autogroup<br />scheduling, if you want the autogroup policy to take effect, it would<br />be perfectly ok if it really only affected the actual group<br />_allocation_. So when you turn it on, old tty associations that<br />existed before autogroup being turned on would not actually be in<br />their own groups at all. And when you turn it off, existing tty groups<br />would continue to exist, and you'd actually have to open a new window<br />to get processes to no longer be part of any autogroup behavior.<br /><br />See what I'm saying? I still think you're bending over backwards to be<br />"careful" in ways that don't seem to make much sense to me.<br /><br />Now, if there is some really fundamental reason why processes _have_<br />to be disassociated with the group when the autogroup policy changes,<br />that would be a different issue. If the scheduler oopses when it hits<br />a process that was in a tty autogroup but autogrouping has been turned<br />off, _that_ would be a reason to say "recalculate everything when you<br />disable/enable policy groups". But I don't think that's the case.<br /><br />                  Linus<br />--<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
