I'm not surprised. I didn't really expect the /proc/kallsyms<br />mode change to trigger anything like what Sarah reported, and<br />user-space just being buggy because the error case had never even been<br />tested is quite understandable.<br /><br />But the thing is, it doesn't even matter.<br /><br />The rule is not "we don't break non-buggy user space" or "we don't<br />break reasonable user-space". The rule is simply "we don't break<br />user-space".<br /><br />Even if the breakage is totally incidental, that doesn't help the<br />_user_. It's still breakage.<br /><br />We still have magic scheduler debug options to run children before<br />parents after fork, simply because that used to _hide_ a race<br />condition in some older "bash" versions (or maybe it was the other way<br />around, whatever).<br /><br />The thing is, bugs happen. And if they never had test coverage, we<br />can't blame people for them. Saying "tough luck, we changed it, and<br />you did something wrong" may be manly, but it's also unacceptable. The<br />developer may fix his bug, but there's still users out there.<br /><br />Now, there _are_ exceptions. There are always exceptions. Intelligent<br />people don't run things off a script, and it's obviously always to<br />some degree a judgment call. The breakage has to be balanced against<br />the upsides. If the kernel behavior change is due to some fundamental<br />security issue or a major redesign that we _had_ to do to make<br />progress, and the user-level breakage is reasonably well-contained,<br />we'll just say "sorry, we had to do it".<br /><br />In this case, the upside just wasn't big enough to accept _any_<br />breakage, especially since people and distributions can just do the<br />"chmod" themselves if they want to. There was a lot of discussion<br />whether the patch should even go in in the first place. So this time,<br />the "let's just revert it" was a very easy decision for me.<br /><br />              Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
