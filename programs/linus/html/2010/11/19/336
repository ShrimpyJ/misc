Yes, git is<br />smart enough that it will merge it all fine, but dammit, now that<br />multi-hundred-line Radeon commit exists twice in the tree. Do this:<br /><br />   git show --stat 16790569eddf fba4312e223f<br />   git show --stat 21e2eae4daae a41c73e04673<br /><br />and cry.<br /><br />And yeah, it's ugly. And if that patch introduces a regression (which<br />is entirely possible, it's not like it's small and trivial and<br />obviously correct) it will just make bisection harder, and add<br />confusion.  And it's totally pointless. It only adds pain. And it<br />makes the history harder to read.<br /><br />Why did the Intel drm tree merge a patch that had _nothing_<br />what-so-ever to do with Intel DRM? WHY?<br /><br />And why did the drm tree rebase a tree that had obviously been public<br />and pulled from? WHY? Why did you make it public before it was ready?<br />And/or why was it so ugly that it needed to rebase it? Why do these<br />things keep happening?<br /><br />What's wrong with the whole drm crowd? Even if it isn't rebasing, why<br />is drivers/gpu/drm always so very visible in the later -rc trees?<br /><br />I'm asking "why", but what I really want you guys to do is to ask<br />_yourself_ why. And ask "Why is that? What am I doing wrong that this<br />keeps happening?"<br /><br />Really. Spend some time pondering. What the hell just happened, and<br />why did it happen, and how can you guys stop doing it?<br /><br />Chris: stop pulling in random crap in your tree. Do _your_ development<br />in your tree. Nothing else.<br /><br />And Dave, I have no idea why those two commits were rebased. They seem<br />identical in the tree that Chris had pulled. They have the same base<br />commit. What was the point?<br /><br />                     Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
