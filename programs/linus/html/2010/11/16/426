And have you noticed people complaining about stuttering while<br />they run just their desktop app? No.<br /><br />That's the thing. If you run a web browser and you use a flash player<br />to view youtube or whatever in it, and only use other interactive<br />desktop apps anyway, you won't see any problems _regardless_. It's not<br />like the other desktop app you have open (and is idle, because you're<br />not touching it) will matter.<br /><br />Ask yourself who is complaining? _I_ have been complaining for years<br />about desktop latency. I usually do it in private to developers, but<br />trust me, I do it. Much of it has been about IO (the whole fsync<br />fiasco), but some of it has been about the scheduler.<br /><br />Look at who were trying out Con's patches. They were compiling things<br />and running games at the same time. That's literally the kind of loads<br />that people were looking at. Partly because that's the kinds of loads<br />we haven't been good at. And it's the kind of load that this helps<br />with.<br /><br />Anyway, I find it depressing that now that this is solved, people come<br />out of the woodwork and say "hey you could do this". Where were you<br />guys a year ago or more?<br /><br />Tough. I found out that I can solve it using cgroups, I asked people<br />to comment and help, and I think the kernel approach is wonderful and<br />_way_ simpler than the scripts I've seen. Yes, I'm biased ("kernels<br />are easy - user space maintenance is a big pain").<br /><br />                   Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
