We support it for ISA cards (and <br />"ISA" here tends to mean PCMCIA - there are almost no other ISA forms <br />left), but it just doesn't work very well.<br /><br />&gt; Well, before giving up entirely, assume that *some* device owns that<br />&gt; interrupt, it's just mis-routed.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; So start calling the IRQ handlers for *every* PCI device until the<br />&gt; damn interrupt goes away, or you've really proved that it can't<br />&gt; be shut up.<br /><br />Sure, you can add crap upon crap upon crap for these things. I pretty much <br />guarantee you that it's not going to work, though. Why? Because developers <br />won't even be working on those machines that have irq routing problems, so <br />they won't be testing things that way, and because if you have irq routing <br />problems, your problems are so fundamental that it really isn't worth it <br />any more.<br /><br />We've added basic _debugging_ facilities (the whole "nobody cared" thing <br />is really a debugging thing, not a "make it work" thing). That was big, <br />because it used to be that a screaming interrupt just locked up the whole <br />machine - notably you inserted a PCMCIA card, and the machine would just <br />lock up (sometimes it would come back when you removed the card again).<br /><br />Trying to work around it is basically not worthwhile. You need to fix the <br />problem. Interrupts are very fundamental, you don't want to be guessing <br />about them. If they are wrong, you're screwed.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
