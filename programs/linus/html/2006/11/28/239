No question about it.<br /><br />HOWEVER. It's _not_ really interesting to hear about a local variable that <br />happens to have a common name that is also shared by a extern function. <br /><br />There just isn't any room for confusion, and it's actually not even that <br />unusual - I tried using -Wshadow on real programs, and it was just <br />horribly irritating.<br /><br />In the kernel, we had obvious things like local use of "jiffies" that just <br />make _total_ sense in a small inline function, and the fact that there <br />happens to be an extern declaration for "jiffies" just isn't very <br />interesting.<br /><br />Similarly, with nested macro expansion, even the "local variable shadows <br />another local variable" case - that looks like it should have an obvious <br />warning on the face of it - really isn't always necessarily that <br />interesting after all. Maybe it is a bug, maybe it isn't, but it's no <br />longer _obviously_ bogus any more.<br /><br />So I'm not convinced about the usefulness of "-Wshadow". ESPECIALLY the <br />way that gcc implements it, it's almost totally useless in real life.<br /><br />For example, I tried it on "git" one time, and this is a perfect example <br />of why "-Wshadow" is totally broken:<br /><br />	diff-delta.c: In function 'create_delta_index':<br />	diff-delta.c:142: warning: declaration of 'index' shadows a global declaration<br /><br />(and there's a _lot_ of those). If I'm not allowed to use "index" as a <br />local variable and include &lt;string.h&gt; at the same time, something is <br />simply SERIOUSLY WRONG with the warning.<br /><br />So the fact is, the C language has scoping rules for a reason. Can you <br />screw yourself by usign them badly? Sure. But that does NOT mean that the <br />same name in different scopes is a bad thing that should be warned about.<br /><br />If I wanted a language that didn't allow me to do anything wrong, I'd be <br />using Pascal. As it is, it turns out that things that "look" wrong on a <br />local level are often not wrong after all.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
