The advantages of MSI aren't all that obvious, and the <br />disadvantages seem to be that it just doesn't work all that well for some <br />people.<br /><br />The fact that it works for MOST people has absolutely zero relevance. <br />We've had too many frigging patches that have apparently been of the "this <br />works for me, I don't care if some other motherboard has problems" kind.<br /><br />See for example:<br /><br />	<a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/7/164">http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/10/7/164</a><br /><br />and yes, that HDA MSI _does_ seem to be causing problems.<br /><br />So don't blather about "MSI never causes problems". It's broken. Please <br />stop living in denial.<br /><br />When somebody can actually say what the huge advantages to MSI are that <br />it's worth using when <br /><br /> (a) several motherboards are apparently known broken<br /><br /> (b) microsoft apparently is of the same opinion and _also_ doesn't use it<br /><br /> (c) the old non-MSI code works fine<br /><br /> (d) there is apparently no fool-proof way to tell when it works and when <br />     it doesn't.<br /><br />then please holler. Btw, I'm not even _interested_ in any advantages <br />unless you also have a solution for (d). Not a "it should work". I want to <br />hear something that is _guaranteed_ to work.<br /><br />Until that point, I will suggest that we always just disable MSI by <br />default, and people who want to use it need to enable it BY HAND.<br /><br />F*ck whitelists. It's better and easier to just NOT USE IT! There are <br />basically zero advantages to using MSI anyway, until you get to big enough <br />systems that you have a system maintainer that can make the decision.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
