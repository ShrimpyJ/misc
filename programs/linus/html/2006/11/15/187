And have the generic code for this just<br />&gt; register the irq handler for both somehow.<br /><br />Well, not generic code. It would have to be the driver itself that does <br />it, since generic code doesn't even know (at irq request time - and when <br />they are generated - it just gets the irq number).<br /><br />And the thing is, once you do that, all the advantages of MSI totally go <br />away - both the "nice" ones and the "really good ones" (the latter being <br />the hopeful eventual removal of irq routing confusions). So if you do <br />that, the better solution is for the driver to say "I won't use MSI at <br />all".<br /><br />Really.<br /><br />It all boils down to the same thing: either we have to know that MSI works <br />(where "know" is obviously relative - it's not like you can avoid _all_ <br />bugs, but dammit, even a single report of "not working" means that there <br />are probably a ton of machines like that, and we did something wrong), or <br />we shouldn't use it. There is no middle ground. You can't really safely <br />"test" for it, and while you _can_ say "just do both", it doesn't really <br />help anything (and potentially exposes you to just more bugs: if enablign <br />MSI actually _does_ disable INTx, but then doesn't work, at a minimum you <br />end up with a device that doesn't work, even if the rest of the kernel <br />might be ok).<br /><br />And btw, I say this as a person whose new main machine used to have HDA <br />routed over MSI, and the decision to default to it off meant that it went <br />back to the regular INTx thing.<br /><br />(Btw, MSI interrupts also seem to not participate in CPU balancing:<br /><br /> 22:      41556      43005   IO-APIC-fasteoi   HDA Intel<br />506:     110417          0   PCI-MSI-edge      eth0<br /><br />which is another semantic change introduced by using MSI)<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
