The legacy vector won't be <br />enabled unless somebody else is on that vector.<br /><br />So yes, this NV HDA sound breakage could easily be because of the <br />interrupt being sent both over legacy INTx _and_ MSI. It would only break <br />for people who happened to have another device sharing the INTx pin (like <br />the report that caused us to disable it by default).<br /><br />However, I really think that this should be a generic PCI layer thing. If <br />some device asks for MSI interrupts, the PCI layer should try to turn off <br />a INTx routing on its own. Asking drivers to do both is just silly, <br />especially since driver writers really shouldn't be expected to know about <br />all these issues (sure, the best ones do, but a lot of driver writers will <br />just say "it works for me").<br /><br />So I don't think the HDA driver should need disable INTx on its own <br />explicitly.<br /><br />If somebody were to write up such a patch and send it to Olivier (and <br />others - I think there was another report of this) for testing (he'd now <br />need to ask for msi irqs explicitly), that might be interesting.
