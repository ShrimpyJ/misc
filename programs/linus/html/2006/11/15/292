I'm really hoping that nobody will cry themselves to sleep over MSI <br />not being enabled..<br /><br />&gt; &gt; (Btw, MSI interrupts also seem to not participate in CPU balancing:<br />&gt; &gt; <br />&gt; &gt;  22:      41556      43005   IO-APIC-fasteoi   HDA Intel<br />&gt; &gt; 506:     110417          0   PCI-MSI-edge      eth0<br />&gt; &gt; <br />&gt; &gt; which is another semantic change introduced by using MSI)<br />&gt; <br />&gt; No, that's most likely because ethernet is always intentionally locked to a<br />&gt; single CPU by irqbalance.<br /><br />Nope, the same thing happened to "HDA Intel" when it was an MSI interrupt <br />(ie before I applied the change that made it not use MSI by default).<br /><br />So I think it's either: (a) irqbalance doesn't balance MSI interrupts at <br />all or (b) the MSI interrupt code doesn't honor balancing requests even if <br />it does.<br /><br />I didn't look any closer. It's not like it's a huge problem for me (or <br />likely for anybody else), but it was interesting to see another <br />"unintended consequence" of the "use MSI or not" choice.<br /><br />The suspend problem reported by Stephen is another such thing - where MSI <br />itself wasn't a problem, but stupid (probably broken) firmware code at <br />wakeup broke it by an unforseen interaction. Again, that is probably <br />related to the fact that nobody has ever really tested it (ie firmware <br />"engineers" obviously didn't actually ever test anything with MSI enabled <br />and in use, and there really is no excuse for firmware messing with the <br />MSI setting - other than the usual "firmware is inevitably buggy" thing).<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
