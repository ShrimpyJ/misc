DISABLE-INTX<br />&gt; is a new bit not present in PCI 2.1 (alas!!).<br /><br />Ok, I would have a few suggestions, then:<br /><br /> - devices that don't support INTx disable should basically be considered <br />   to not support MSI at all (ie a driver simply shouldn't even try to <br />   enable MSI, since enabling MSI includes the implicit DISABLE-INTX)<br /><br />   This is likely ok, since MSI wasn't in PCI 2.1 _either_ afaik. So if <br />   your hardware has MSI, it probably _does_ have DISABLE-INTX (or at <br />   least that bit doesn't do anything bad, which is the other case)<br /><br /> - add a flag to "pci_enable_msi()". There really aren't that many users, <br />   and they basically _all_ want this functionality. Making them call <br />   another function is just a recipe for disaster, since somebody will <br />   forget. Having to just say "do I support INTx disable" is much better, <br />   since it makes the driver writer aware of having to _explicitly_ make <br />   that choice.<br /><br />&gt; Maybe a better solution is letting the driver say "pci_dev-&gt;intx_ok = 1" right<br />&gt; before it calls pci_enable_device().<br /><br />I hate that, for exactly the same reason I hate "pci_intx()". It just <br />means that most drivers won't do it, because it's not even part of the <br />normal sequence, and most people don't care. So again, it would actually <br />be better in that case to just add a "flags" field to pci_enable_device(), <br />although that's a _hell_ of a lot more painful than it would be to do the <br />same to "pci_enable_msi()".<br /><br />&gt; And if we do this, we can follow through on another suggestion I made:<br />&gt; disabling INTx on driver exit, to help eliminate any possibility of screaming<br />&gt; interrupts after driver unload.<br /><br />The thing is, I think that's a bad idea for the same reason it's a bad <br />idea to disable the BAR's (which we tried and then reverted). It's just <br />going to cause problems for soft rebooting etc with firmware that doesn't <br />expect it.<br /><br />A driver should obviously quiesce the device on shutdown, and if it leaves <br />a device in a state where it may still generate interrupts, that's a <br />_bug_, so disabling INTx is just papering over a much more serious issue.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
