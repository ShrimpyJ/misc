And they boil down to something very simple:<br /><br />	"Derived works have to be under the same license"<br /><br />where the rest is just really fluff.<br /><br />But the point is, "derived work" is not what _you_ or _I_ define. It's <br />what copyright law defines.<br /><br />And trying to push that definition too far is a total disaster. If you <br />push the definition of derived work to "anything that touches our work", <br />you're going to end up in a very dark and unhappy place. One where the <br />RIAA is your best buddy.<br /><br />And the proposed "we make some technical measure whereby we draw our _own_ <br />lines" is exactly that total disaster.<br /><br />We don't draw our own lines. We accept that the lines are drawn for us by <br />copyright law, and we actually _hope_ that the lines aren't too sharp and <br />too clearcut. Because sharp edges on copyright is the worst possible <br />situation we could ever be in.<br /><br />The reason fair use is so important is exactly that it blunts/dulls the <br />sharp knife that overly strong copyright protection could be. It would be <br />a total disaster if you couldn't quote other peoples work, and if you <br />couldn't make parodies on them, and if you couldn't legally use the <br />knowledge you gained for them.<br /><br />In other words, copyright MUST NOT be seen as some "we own this, and you <br />have no rights AT ALL unless you play along with our rules". Copyright <br />absolutely _has_ to allow others to have some rights to play according to <br />their rules even without our permission, and even if we don't always agree <br />with what they do.<br /><br />And that is why it would be WRONG to think that we have the absolute right <br />to say "that is illegal". It's simply not our place to make that <br />judgement. When you start thinking that you have absolute control over the <br />content or programs you produce, and that the rest of the worlds opinions <br />doesn't matter, you're just _wrong_.<br /><br />And no, "BECAUSE I'M GOOD" is _not_ an excuse. It's never an excuse to do <br />something like that just because you believe you are "in the right". It <br />doesn't matter _how_ much you believe in freedom, or anything else - <br />everybody _always_ thinks that they are in the right.  The RIAA I'm sure <br />is in a moral lather because they are protecting their own stronghold of <br />morality against the infidels and barbarians at the gate.<br /><br />So don't go talking about how we should twist peoples arms and force them <br />to be open source of free software. Instead, BE HAPPY that people can take <br />advantage of "loopholes" in copyright protections and can legally do <br />things that you as the copyright owner might not like. Because those <br />"loopholes" are in the end what protects YOU.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
