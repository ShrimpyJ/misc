We don't "twist peoples <br />arms". We show people what we think is a better way, and we let them <br />participate. We don't force it, we don't twist it, and it's ok not to <br />believe in the GPL or our ideals. In fact, "our ideals" aren't even one <br />unified thing to begin with.<br /><br />We also don't try to pervert copyright into a "you have to _use_ things <br />in a certain way". We don't think "fair use" is a bad thing. We encourage <br />it, and that means that we have to abide by it ourselves. It means, most <br />particularly, that even people we disagree with have that right of "fair <br />use".<br /><br />That, btw, is what "freedom" and "rights" are all about. It's obly <br />meaningful when you grant those rights to people you don't agree with. <br /><br />Also, since you haven't apparently gotten the memo yet, let me point it <br />out to you: the end results don't justify the means, and never did. So <br />arm-twisting doesn't become good just because you think the end result <br />might be worth it. It's still bad.<br /><br />And btw, that "information freedom" thing you talked about is just so much <br />blather and idiotic hogwash. "Information" doesn't want to be free, nor is <br />it somethign you should fight for or necessarily even encourage.<br /><br />It doesn't hold a candle to _peoples_ freedom, the foremost of which is to <br />just disagree with you. Once you allow people to talk and do what they <br />want, that "information freedom" will follow.<br /><br />It's not a religion, and it's not about suppressing other people and other <br />viewpoints. <br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
