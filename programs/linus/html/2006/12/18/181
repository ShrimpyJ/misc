I think that part of the GPLv3 is a good idea.<br /><br />That said, I think they are still pushing the "you don't have any rights <br />unless we give you additional rights explicitly" angle a bit too hard.<br /><br />The fact is, people DO have rights, regardless of what the license says. <br />We have them when it comes to music, and we have them when it comes to <br />software. Copyright law only gives _limited_ rights to copyright holders, <br />and we should actually fight those rights being expanded, instead of <br />trying to expand on them ourselves.<br /><br />&gt; &gt; No, the sane way to think about it is that linking just creates an <br />&gt; &gt; "aggregate" work.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; That's your take on it.  It does make sense, but claiming it's *the*<br />&gt; sane way to think about it is making the mistake you accused the FSF<br />&gt; of making.<br /><br />I did point that out at the end of the email you quote. I said it's not <br />necessarily the only way to look at things. But I GUARANTEE you that it <br />makes more sense than the "no rights" approach, and I GUARANTEE you that <br />it makes more sense than thinking that "ld is magic, and makes a derived <br />work" approach.<br /><br />&gt; In fact, it can't possibly be exempt by this paragraph in clause 2 of<br />&gt; the GPL:<br />&gt; <br />&gt;   In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the<br />&gt;   Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a<br />&gt;   volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other<br />&gt;   work under the scope of this License.<br /><br />This is actually a red herring. The way the GPLv2 _defines_ "work" and <br />"Program" is by derived "derived work". <br /><br />You're confused by _your_ interpretation of "work" and "Program". You <br />think that "Program" means "binary", because that's you think normally.<br /><br />But the GPLv2 actually defines that "Program" is just the "derivative work <br />under copyright law".<br /><br />Really. Go look. It's right there at the very top, in section 0.<br /><br />In other words, in the GPL, "Program" does NOT mean "binary". Never has.<br /><br />And in fact, it wouldn't make sense if it did, since you can use the GPL <br />for other things than just programs (and people have).<br /><br />So you _always_ get back to the question: what is "derivative"? And the <br />GPLv2 doesn't actually even say anything about that, but EXPLICITLY says <br />that it is left to copyright law.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
