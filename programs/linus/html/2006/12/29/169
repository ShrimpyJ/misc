It is the kernel's core<br />&gt; representation of a disk block.<br /><br />Please come back from the 90's.<br /><br />The buffer heads are nothing but a mapping of where the hardware block is. <br />If you use it for anything else, you're basically screwed.<br /><br />&gt; JBD implements physical block-based journalling, so it is 100% appropriate<br />&gt; that JBD deal with these disk blocks using their buffer_head<br />&gt; representation.<br /><br />And as long as it does that, you just have to face the fact that it's <br />going to perform like crap, including what you call "extra" writes, and <br />what I call "deal with it".<br /><br />Btw, you can make pages be physically indexed too, but they obviously<br /> (a) won't be coherent with any virtual mapping laid on top of it<br /> (b) will be _physical_, so any readahead etc will be based on physical <br />     addresses too.<br /><br />&gt; I thought I fixed the performance problem?<br /><br />No, you papered over it, for the reasonably common case where things were <br />physically contiguous - exactly by using a physical page cache, so now it <br />can do read-ahead based on that. Then, because the pages contain buffer <br />heads, the directory accesses can look up buffers, and if it was all <br />physically contiguous, it all works fine.<br /><br />But if you actually want virtualluy indexed caching (and all _users_ want <br />it), it really doesn't work.<br /><br />&gt; Somewhat nastily, but as ext3 directories are metadata it is appropriate<br />&gt; that modifications to them be done in terms of buffer_heads (ie: blocks).<br /><br />No. There is nothing "appropriate" about using buffer_heads for metadata. <br /><br />It's quite proper - and a hell of a lot more efficient - to use virtual <br />page-caching for metadata too.<br /><br />Look at the ext2 readdir() implementation, and compare it to the crapola <br />horror that is ext3. Guess what? ext2 uses virtually indexed metadata, and <br />as a result it is both simpler, smaller and a LOT faster than ext3 in <br />accessing that metadata.<br /><br />Face it, Andrew, you're wrong on this one. Really. Just take a look at <br />ext2_readdir(). <br /><br />[ I'm not saying that ext2_readdir() is _beautiful_. If it had been <br />  written with the page cache in mind, it would probably have been done <br />  very differently. And it doesn't do any readahead, probably because <br />  nobody cared enough, but it should be trivial to add, and it would <br />  automatically "do the right thing" just because it's much easier at the <br />  page cache level.<br /><br />  But I _am_ saying that compared to ext3, the ext2 readdir is a work of <br />  art. ]<br /><br />"metadata" has _zero_ to do with "physically indexed". There is no <br />correlation what-so-ever. If you think there is a correlation, it's all in <br />your mind.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
