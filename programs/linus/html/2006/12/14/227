Furthermore he imported third <br />&gt; party GPL code using the license as sole permission. So he may have dug <br />&gt; a personal hole but many of the rest of us have been repeatedly saying <br />&gt; whenever he said that - that we do not agree.<br /><br />[ The "he" being me in the above ]<br /><br />Btw, I'd like to make it clear in this discussion too (as I have in <br />others), that I agree 100% with Alan here. <br /><br />The thing is, my opinion is really just _my_ opinion. People shouldn't see <br />it as anything else. When I say "I don't think we should totally disallow <br />binary modules", you should always keep in mind that:<br /><br /> - the fact that I think that _some_ binary modules may be perfectly legal <br />   does not mean that I think _all_ binary modules would be legal. I think <br />   there are lots of ways to make such a binary module that is obviously <br />   not ok.<br /><br /> - I really _am_ just one of hundreds of copyright owners. The fact that <br />   _I_ am not necessarily all that eager to take things to court should in <br />   no way be seen as estoppel for _others_ who decide that they want to <br />   flex their legal rights.<br /><br />So when I "may have dug a personal hole", please realize that this is <br />actually a personal - and conscious - choice. I've never wanted to do <br />copyright assignments, for several reasons: I think they are nasty and <br />wrong personally, and I'd hate all the paperwork, and I think it would <br />actually detract from the development model.<br /><br />But one of the reasons I've never wanted copyright assignments is that I'm <br />personally actually _more_ comfortable with the system being co-owned. I <br />_like_ having my hands bound, and being in that hole. Not because of any <br />strange sexual hangups either, but simply because I think being personally <br />limited is something that makes people trust me more in the end - or <br />rather, it is something that means that people don't _have_ to trust me.<br /><br />So people know that I can't unilaterally change the license. And they <br />_know_ that they can actually take things to court on their own. AND THAT <br />IS A GOOD THING. The last thing anybody _ever_ wants is to have me having <br />absolute powers. Not you guys, and certainly not me.<br /><br />So you guys should always be happy, realizing that Linus may have his <br />quirks, but that my quirks can't ever really screw you guys up.<br /><br />So I repeat: my opinions are _my_ opinions. Nobody else is legally bound <br />by them. And I'm certainly willing to bend my behaviour in the presense of <br />pressure (I think only mindless idiots can't change their mind - I <br />personally change some of my opinions several times a day just to keep <br />them fresh), but in somethign like this, where I _do_ have a fairly strong <br />opinion, I really think that this kind of patch has to be merged in <br />somebody elses tree than mine.<br /><br />If, after a year, it turns out that my tree is the only one that doesn't <br />have that clause, I think I'll either get the hint, or people will realize <br />that I'm pointless and will just ignore me. It will have taken you long <br />enough to realize that ;)<br /><br />Because one of the great things about the GPL is that _nobody_ has the <br />power to deny other peoples will.
