It may, or it may <br />not. It really isn't up to you to decide whether it does (and notice how <br />I'm not saying that it's up to _me_ either!).<br /><br />For example, all the same people who clamor for free software get <br />absolutely RABID about "fair use". Guess what "fair use" actually MEANS? <br /><br />Think about it for a moment. It expressly _limits_ the right of copyright <br />authors to claim "derived work". So if you argue that anything that ever <br />includes your header file (but none of your code) and compiles against it <br />is a "derived work", then you are basically very close to arguing that <br />"fair use" does not exist.<br /><br />Do you really want to argue that "everything that has touched anything <br />copyrighted AT ALL is a derived work"? Do you feel lucky, punk?<br /><br />THAT is why I think this discussion is so hypocritical. Either you accept <br />that "fair use" and copyrights aren't black-and-white, or you don't.<br /><br />If you think this is a black-and-white "copyright owners have all the <br />rights", then you're standing with the RIAA's and the MPAA's of the world.<br /><br />Me, personally, I think the RIAA and the MPAA is a shithouse. They are <br />immoral. But guess what? They are immoral exactly _because_ they think <br />that they automatically own ALL the rights, just because they own the <br />copyright.<br /><br />That is what it boils down to: copyright doesn't really give you "absolute <br />power". This is why I have been _consistently_ arguing that we're not <br />about "black and white" or "good against evil". It simply isn't that <br />simple.<br /><br />I don't like binary modules. I refuse to support them, and if it turns out <br />that the module was written using Linux code, and just for Linux, I htink <br />that's a _clear_ copyright violation, and that binary module is obviously <br />a license violation.<br /><br />But if the module was written for other systems, and just ported to Linux, <br />and not using our code, then it's very much debatable whether it's <br />actually a "derived work". Interfaces don't make "derived works" per se. <br /><br />Now, is it something you could sue people over? Sure. I actually do <br />believe that it's very possible that a judge _would_ consider such a <br />module a derived work, and you can sue people. It probably depends on <br />circumstances too. <br /><br />But don't you see the problem with a black-and-white technical measure?<br /><br />Don't you see the problem with the DMCA and the DVD encryption? <br /><br />Those kinds of things REMOVE the "reasonable thought" from the equation, <br />and turn a gradual process into a sharp "right or wrong" situation. AND <br />THAT IS WRONG. We simply do not LIVE in a world that is black and white.<br /><br />So if you think somebody violates your copyright, send them a C&amp;D letter, <br />and eventually take them to court. It's been done. Companies that mis-used <br />the GPL have actually been sued, and THEY HAVE LOST. That's a GOOD thing. <br />I'm not arguing against that at all. What I'm arguing against is the <br />"blind belief" that you or I have the right to tell people what to do, <br />just because we own copyrights.<br /><br />It's not a blind belief that I'm willing to subscribe to. Exactly because <br />I have _seen_ what that blind belief results in - crap like the DMCA and <br />the RIAA lawsuits.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
