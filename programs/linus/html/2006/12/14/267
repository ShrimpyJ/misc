Sure, it's marked <br />becasue it's internal, but why is does that have to be pointed out at all? <br />Why not use the same EXPORT_SYMBOL? The answer to that is the "GPL" part, <br />ie the expectation that internal symbols are so internal that they have <br />license effects.<br /><br />And if you were an external vendor doing binary only modules, would you <br />react to "internal"? It wouldn't have the same "oh, _that_ is what it is <br />all about" thing, would it?<br /><br />So I do agree that we have probably done a bad job of explaining why that <br />_GPL thing makes sense, and what it means on a deeper level (the license <br />thing is a very superficial thing, but its worth naming just because the <br />superficial thing is also the biggest _impact_ - even if it may not be the <br />underlying deeper _reason_ for it).<br /><br />So which makes more sense from a naming standpoint: the superficial impact <br />that is what _matters_ for people, or the more subtle issue that causes it <br />to have that impact?<br /><br />I think that question is what it boils down to, and at least personally, <br />while I see both things as being worthwhile, I think the superficial thing <br />is the one that needs pointing out, because it's the one that may change <br />your behaviour (while the deeper _meaning_ is more of just an <br />explanation).<br /><br />But I don't personally care that deeply. I mostly care about the fact that <br />changing the name now would just be inconvenient and unnecessary churn, <br />and that's probably my biggest reason to not want to do it ;)<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
