Sadly, in this day and age, "copyright owner" and "author" only bear <br />a very passing resemblance to each other.<br /><br />In a lot of areas, the AUTHOR may be a very reasonable person, and realize <br />that fair use is a good thing, and perhaps even realize that in some <br />places even unfair use can be a good thing (do you really think you should <br />pay $20 for a DVD if you make $3 a month in a sweatshop in china? Maybe <br />piracy sometimes is simply better..)<br /><br />But the author may also have his own reasons for wanting to _deny_ fair <br />use. Maybe he's just a royal a-hole, and wants to milk his work for <br />whatever it's worth. But maybe he's a person with an agenda, and wants to <br />ignore fair use because he wants to "improve the world for everybody", <br />never mind that he tries to deny people a fundamental right in the <br />process. I call those people a-holes too (in all fairness, they return the <br />favor, so we're all even ;)<br /><br />But even more commonly, the author simply doesn't control the copyright at <br />all any more. In many areas (and software is one - including even large <br />swaths of free software), the copyrights of a work is not really <br />controlled by the author of the work, but by companies or foundations that <br />have no reason to really try to educate people about "fair use".<br /><br />So I actually think that the authors that actually UNDERSTAND fair use, <br />and realize that people can use portions of their work without permission, <br />AND that actually control their work is a very very very small subset of <br />authors in general.<br /><br />This has nothing to do with software per se, btw. Pick up one of the <br />Calvin &amp; Hobbes books by Bill Watterson - I think it may have been the "10 <br />year anniversary" one - where he talks about the disagreements he had with <br />the people who actually controlled the copyrights (and I think also some <br />of the people who used his artwork without any permission - the line <br />between "fair use" and "illegal" really is a murky one, and while we <br />should celebrate that murkiness, it's also why people disagree).<br /><br />&gt; &gt; And I'd rather teach people that fundamental fact, than try to confuse the <br />&gt; &gt; issue EVEN MORE by saying that my copyright only extends to derived works <br />&gt; &gt; in the license text. That will just make people think that if the license <br />&gt; &gt; does NOT say that, they don't have fair use. AND THAT IS WRONG.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; That's a valid point. What is really needed is to tell them that if they<br />&gt; doubt, they just have to ask the author and not be advised by any GPL zealot.<br /><br />Well, in open source, there often isn't any one "the author". So you can't <br />do that. And when there is, as mentioned, he may not actually even have <br />the legal right any more to give you any license advice. And even when he <br />does hold the copyrights, he may change his mind later.<br /><br />So in the end, the thing you can and should depend on is: the license text <br />itself (and happily, the GPLv2 very clearly talks about the real line <br />being "derived work" - it may be a murky line, and they seem to want to <br />change that to something harder in the GPLv3, but it's a good line), a <br />separate signed contract, or simply a legal opinion, preferably by a judge <br />in a court of law. <br /><br />Of course, it very seldom gets to that kind of issue. People tend to just <br />walk very gently around it all.<br /><br />If you want to be safe, you NEVER do any binary modules. The only <br />_obviously_ safe thing is to always do only what the license very <br />explicitly allows you to, and in the case of the GPLv2, that's to release <br />all modifications under the same GPLv2.<br /><br />Anything else, you have to make some really scary decisions. Can a judge <br />decide that a binary module is a derived work even though you didn't <br />actually use any code? The real answer is: HELL YES. It's _entirely_ <br />possible that a judge would find NVidia and ATI in violation of the GPLv2 <br />with their modules.<br /><br />Judges have done stranger things. And it's not my place to say what the <br />limit of "derived work" actually is. It all probably depends on a lot of <br />circumstances, and there simply isn't an easy answer.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
