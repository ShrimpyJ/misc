GPL[23] covers only to "distibution" of the <br />&gt; covered program. The freedom #0 says explicitly: "right to use the program <br />&gt; for any purpose".<br /><br />I'm sorry, but you're just rewriting history.<br /><br />The FSF very much _has_ tried to make "fair use" a very restricted issue. <br />The whole reason the LGPL exists is that people realized that if they <br />don't do something like that, the GPL would have been tried in court, and <br />the FSF's position that anything that touches GPL'd code would probably <br />have been shown to be bogus.<br /><br />In reality, if the FSF actually believed in "fair use", they would just <br />have admitted that GNU libc could have continued to be under the GPL, and <br />that any programs that link against it are obviously not "derived" from <br />it.<br /><br />But no. The FSF has very much tried to confuse and muddle the issue, and <br />instead have claimed that projects like glibc should be done under the <br />"Lesser" GPL.<br /><br />That's just idiocy, but it works as a way to defuse the problem that the <br />FSF has always had with admitting that not only _they_ have "fair use" <br />rights, but others have them too.<br /><br />Do you REALLY believe that a binary becomes a "derived work" of any random <br />library that it gets linked against? If that's not "fair use" of a library <br />that implements a standard library definition, I don't know what is.<br /><br />And yes, the FSF really has tried to push that totally insane argument. <br /><br />So don't tell me that the FSF honors "fair use". They say they do, but <br />they only seem to honor it when it helps _their_ argument, not when it <br />helps "those evil people who try to take advantage of our hard work".<br /><br />The fact is, if you accept fair use, you have to accept it for other <br />people to take advantage of too. Fair use really isn't just a one-way <br />street.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
