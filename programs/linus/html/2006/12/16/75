People <br />who actually do "original work" tend to all realize that everybody really <br />feeds off of each others works, and that we're all inspired by authors etc <br />that went before us. So I doubt a lot of real authors, musicians or <br />computer programmers will actually disagree with the notion of fair use, <br />but it's important to realize that fair use is exactly for when the users <br />and the authors rights clash, and the user DOES have rights. Even rights <br />that weren't explicitly given to them by the author.<br /><br />&gt; For this exact reason, I have added a "LICENSE" file [1] in my software <br />&gt; (haproxy) stating that I explicitly permit linking with binary code if <br />&gt; the user has no other choice (eg: protocols specs obtained under NDA), <br />&gt; provided that "derived work" does not steal any GPL code (include files <br />&gt; are under LGPL). On the other hand, all "common protocols" are <br />&gt; developped under GPL so that normal users are the winners, and everyone <br />&gt; is strongly encouraged to use the GPL for their new code to benefit from <br />&gt; everyone else's eyes on the code.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; This clarifies my intent and let developers decide whether *they* are<br />&gt; doing legal things or not.<br /><br />I think that's fine, and I think it may make some of your users happier, <br />and breathe more easily. I don't disagree with that kind of clarification.<br /><br />But:<br /><br />&gt; Don't you think it would be a good idea to add such a precision in the<br />&gt; sources ?<br /><br />I think it would be a hell of a lot better idea if people just realized <br />that they have "fair use" rights whether the authors give them or not, and <br />that the authors copyrights NEVER extend to anything but a "derived work".<br /><br />I find the RIAA's position and the DMCA distasteful, and in that I <br />probably have a lot of things in common with a lot of people on this list. <br />But by _exactly_ the same token, I also find the FSF's position and a lot <br />of GPL zealots' position on this matter very distasteful.<br /><br />Because "fair use" is NOT somethng that should be specified in the <br />license. It's very much something that people have DESPITE any license <br />claiming otherwise.<br /><br />And I'd rather teach people that fundamental fact, than try to confuse the <br />issue EVEN MORE by saying that my copyright only extends to derived works <br />in the license text. That will just make people think that if the license <br />does NOT say that, they don't have fair use.
