Because<br />&gt; of this, a one year notice for everyone to address any non-GPL<br />&gt; compatible modules has been set.<br /><br />Btw, I really think this is shortsighted.<br /><br />It will only result in _exactly_ the crap we were just trying to avoid, <br />namely stupid "shell game" drivers that don't actually help anything at <br />all, and move code into user space instead.<br /><br />What was the point again?<br /><br />Was the point to alienate people by showing how we're less about the <br />technology than about licenses?<br /><br />Was the point to show that we think we can extend our reach past derived <br />work boundaries by just saying so? <br /><br />The silly thing is, the people who tend to push most for this are the <br />exact SAME people who say that the RIAA etc should not be able to tell <br />people what to do with the music copyrights that they own, and that the <br />DMCA is bad because it puts technical limits over the rights expressly <br />granted by copyright law.<br /><br />Doesn't anybody else see that as being hypocritical?<br /><br />So it's ok when we do it, but bad when other people do it? Somehow I'm not <br />surprised, but I still think it's sad how you guys are showing a marked <br />two-facedness about this.<br /><br />The fact is, the reason I don't think we should force the issue is very <br />simple: copyright law is simply _better_off_ when you honor the admittedly <br />gray issue of "derived work". It's gray. It's not black-and-white. But <br />being gray is _good_. Putting artificial black-and-white technical <br />counter-measures is actually bad. It's bad when the RIAA does it, it's bad <br />when anybody else does it.<br /><br />If a module arguably isn't a derived work, we simply shouldn't try to say <br />that its authors have to conform to our worldview.<br /><br />We should make decisions on TECHNICAL MERIT. And this one is clearly being <br />pushed on anything but.<br /><br />I happen to believe that there shouldn't be technical measures that keep <br />me from watching my DVD or listening to my music on whatever device I damn <br />well please. Fair use, man. But it should go the other way too: we should <br />not try to assert _our_ copyright rules on other peoples code that wasn't <br />derived from ours, or assert _our_ technical measures that keep people <br />from combining things their way.<br /><br />If people take our code, they'd better behave according to our rules. But <br />we shouldn't have to behave according to the RIAA rules just because we <br />_listen_ to their music. Similarly, nobody should be forced to behave <br />according to our rules just because they _use_ our system. <br /><br />There's a big difference between "copy" and "use". It's exatcly the same <br />issue whether it's music or code. You can't re-distribute other peoples <br />music (becuase it's _their_ copyright), but they shouldn't put limits on <br />how you personally _use_ it (because it's _your_ life).<br /><br />Same goes for code. Copyright is about _distribution_, not about use. We <br />shouldn't limit how people use the code.<br /><br />Oh, well. I realize nobody is likely going to listen to me, and everybody <br />has their opinion set in stone. <br /><br />That said, I'm going to suggest that you people talk to your COMPANY <br />LAWYERS on this, and I'm personally not going to merge that particular <br />code unless you can convince the people you work for to merge it first.<br /><br />In other words, you guys know my stance. I'll not fight the combined <br />opinion of other kernel developers, but I sure as hell won't be the first <br />to merge this, and I sure as hell won't have _my_ tree be the one that <br />causes this to happen.<br /><br />So go get it merged in the Ubuntu, (Open)SuSE and RHEL and Fedora trees <br />first. This is not something where we use my tree as a way to get it to <br />other trees. This is something where the push had better come from the <br />other direction.<br /><br />Because I think it's stupid.
