I think it's been too late to try to actually _fix_ it for <br />2.6.18 for a long time already.<br /><br />So my reaction is that this redesign should go in asap after 2.6.18, <br />unless people feel strongly that the current locking has so many bugs that <br />people can actually _hit_ in practice that it's better to go for the <br />redesign early.<br /><br />I personally doubt that it's the case that we'd want to accelerate <br />inclusion - very few things actually do CPU hotplug, and right now the <br />only way to even hit the sequences in normal use is literally just the <br />"suspend under SMP" case that hasn't historically worked very well anyway, <br />but was what made at least me personally aware of the problems ;^).<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
