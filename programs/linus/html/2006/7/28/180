Interfaces need to be architected, make sense, and have <br />   real and valid GPL'd uses.<br /><br />In other words, if a filesystem wants to do something fancy, it needs to <br />do so WITH THE VFS LAYER, not as some plugin architecture of its own. We <br />already have exactly the plugin interface we need, and it literally _is_ <br />the VFS interfaces - you can plug in your own filesystems with <br />"register_filesystem()", which in turn indirectly allows you to plug in <br />your per-file and per-directory operations for things like lookup etc.<br /><br />If that isn't enough, then the filesystem shouldn't make its own internal <br />plug-in architecture that bypasses the VFS layer and exposes functionality <br />that isn't necessarily sane. For example, reiser4 used to have (perhaps <br />still does) these cool files that can be both directories and links, and I <br />don't mind that at all, but I _do_ mind the fact that when Al Viro (long <br />long ago) pointed out serious locking issues with them, those seemed to be <br />totally brushed away.<br /><br />So as far as I'm concerned, the problem with reiser4 is that it hasn't <br />tried to work with the VFS people. Now, I realize that the main VFS people <br />aren't always easy to work with (Al and Christoph, take a bow), but that <br />doesn't really change the basic facts. Al in particular is _always_ right. <br />I don't think I've ever had the cojones to argue with Al..<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
