The kernel, in many ways, these <br />days does something even stronger, in the sense that we now ask not that <br />every file be marked, but each and every change be signed-off-on. It's <br />more than a copyright issue, of course (it started out motivated by the <br />worries of tracking codeflow, but I think one reason it has worked so well <br />is that it's become useful for so many other things).<br /><br />So lots of projects have their specific rules. I don't think the "add <br />notice to every file" is wrong per se, I just think it's impractical: not <br />only does it get unwieldly with all those messages at the top, usually an <br />open source project ends up being a mix of lots of different people that <br />own rights in it, and in many ways it's thus better to track at a change <br />level rather than a file level if you do tracking.<br /><br />But exactly because it doesn't have any real legal rules, the rules are <br />from other sources, and boil down mainly to just per-project "coding <br />style" issues.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
