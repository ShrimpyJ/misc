IMHO, Linux has the power and influence<br />&gt; to move mountains in the software industry, and shouldn't shy away from<br />&gt; the opportunity to take moral responsibility when it arises.<br /><br />Well, you do have to realize that Linux has never been an FSF project, and <br />in fact has never even been a "Free Software" project.<br /><br />The whole "Open Source" renaming was done largely _exactly_ because people <br />wanted to distance themselves from the FSF. The fact that the FSF and it's <br />followers refused to accept the name "Open Source", and continued to call <br />Linux "Free Software" is not _our_ fault.<br /><br />Similarly, the fact that rms and the FSF has tried to paint Linux as a GNU <br />project (going as far as trying to rename it "GNU/Linux" at every <br />opportunity they get) is their confusion, not ours.<br /><br />I personally have always been very clear about this: Linux is "Open <br />Source". It was never a FSF project, and it was always about giving source <br />code back and keeping it open, not about anything else. The very first <br />license used for the kernel was _not_ the GPL at all, but read the release <br />notes for Linux 0.01, and you will see:<br /><br />		2. Copyrights etc<br /><br />  This kernel is (C) 1991 Linus Torvalds, but all or part of it may be<br />  redistributed provided you do the following:<br /><br />	- Full source must be available (and free), if not with the<br />	  distribution then at least on asking for it.<br /><br />	- Copyright notices must be intact. (In fact, if you distribute<br />	  only parts of it you may have to add copyrights, as there aren't<br />	  (C)'s in all files.) Small partial excerpts may be copied<br />	  without bothering with copyrights.<br /><br />	- You may not distibute this for a fee, not even "handling"<br />	  costs.<br /><br />notice? Linux from the very beginning was not about the FSF ideals, but <br />about "Full source must be available". It also talked about "Free", but <br />that very much was "Free as in beer, not as in freedom", and I decided to <br />drop that later on.<br /><br />How much clearer can I be? I've actively tried to promote "Open Source" as <br />an alternative to "Free Software", so the FSF only has itself to blame <br />over the confusion. <br /><br />Thinking that Linux has followed FSF goals is incorrect. IT NEVER DID!<br /><br />I think the GPLv2 is an absolutely great license. I obviously relicensed <br />everything just a few months after releasing the first version of Linux. <br />But people who claim that that means that I (or anybody else) should care <br />what the FSF thinks on other issues are just being totally silly.<br /><br />&gt; What is the stance of the developer team / kernel maintainers on DRM,<br />&gt; Trusted Computing and software patents?<br /><br />I'm very much on record as not liking them. That changes nothing. I'm also <br />very much on record as saying that DRM, TPC etc have nothing at all to do <br />with the kernel license.<br /><br />If you want to fight DRM, do so by joining the Creative Commons movement. <br />The problem with Disney is not that they use DRM, it's that they control <br />the content in the first place - and they do that because content tends to <br />be too monopolized. <br /><br />The whole "content" discussion has _nothing_ to do with an operating <br />system. Trying to add that tie-in is a bad idea. It tries to link things <br />that aren't relevant. <br /><br />So go fight the problem at the _source_ of the problem, not in my project <br />that has got nothing to do it.<br /><br />And please, when you join that fight, use your _own_ copyrights. Not <br />somebody elses. I absolutely hate how the FSF has tried to use my code as <br />a weapon, just because I decided that their license was good.<br /><br />&gt; How about a public poll?<br /><br />Here's a poll for you:<br /> - go write your own kernel<br /> - poll which one is more popular<br /><br />It really is that simple. The kernel was released with a few rules. The <br />same way you can't just make your own version of it and then not release <br />sources, you _also_ cannot just make it GPLv3. <br /><br />It's not a democracy. Copyright is a _right_.
