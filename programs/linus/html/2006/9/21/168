In other words, arbitrary <br />rules are not actually disliked at all, people actually _like_ them, <br />because suddenly there's less need for making unnecessary judgement <br />decisions.<br /><br />As an example: I thought I'd get a lot of back-lash on the whole sign-off <br />procedure. Instead, we're basically signing off everything, and having a <br />few simple rules ended up making it just easier to forward stuff, and we <br />haven't had any of the discussions about who gets to be attributed as an <br />author since the sign-off was introduced. That was a totally unexpected <br />bonus, as far as I was concerned.<br /><br />The same goes for my anal efforts at trying to make people use a specific <br />format for sending patches, and sending the "please pull" messages. I'm <br />not hearing any grumbling about it at all, and in fact I'm getting the <br />distinct feeling that people like knowing exactly what format to use, <br />because they didn't really care themselves, and it turns out that having <br />any rule - even if it's fairly arbitrary - seems to be better than not <br />having a rule at all.<br /><br />So I think that a "odd release"/"even release" rule that clarifies what a <br />certain mid-point in the release cycle actually _means_, even if it <br />doesn't necessarily add anything else, might be a good thing. It just <br />solidifies peoples expectations about where we are in a release cycle.<br /><br />If we make an arbitrary rule to go with the release cycle ("leading up to <br />the even cycle, you need to get an ack from somebody that actually tested <br />the fix") that could actually be a good thing, for this reason. <br /><br />I dunno. Maybe the only arbitrary rule ends up being that an "odd release" <br />would become a good place for people to try, knowing that we expect bug <br />reports from them. Right now -rc1 might be _too_ scary, even if it ends up <br />being exactly that: the only difference is really not about technology, <br />but about what peoples expectations are.<br /><br />If we could instill a culture of "if you aren't a developer, but you just <br />want to help out, try the odd releases", that in itself might be worth the <br />naming change. If it would allow a group of people who might not feel <br />comfortable about reporting problems with a "-rc" to feel like they are <br />_expected_ to report a problem with an odd release, then that would be a <br />good thing, no?<br /><br />I'm just throwing this out as an idea. I'm not going to really argue very <br />strongly for it. It might have horrible downsides too, for all I know, and <br />we might get people who didn't get the memo on "even vs odd releases" <br />being really unhappy about somethign they perceive to be a buggy release.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
