It's about forcing _more_ sharing even behind the<br />&gt; corporate firewall!<br /><br />In many ways, I agree. The FSF seems to be barking up the wrong tree, the <br />real problem is not things like Tivo (who already _do_ give source back), <br />but the whole "we don't give source back because we're just exporting the <br />results", aka the "ASP problem".<br /><br />&gt;		 In the ideal world that should be the only<br />&gt; priority in FSF minds and I think they're still in time to change<br />&gt; their focus on what really matters.<br /><br />While I agree with you, I think one of the reasons that the FSF hasn't <br />gone that way is that while in many cases it would make sense, it's <br />actually even more controversial. The "Tivo" issue is a populist issue, <br />and trying to solve the "ASP problem" is actually seriously more <br />problematic.<br /><br />First off, the ASP issue, while not in any way limiting "use" (you could <br />still _use_ things as you see fit, you just have to give sources out: I <br />think that's much more "in the spirit" than the current GPLv3 ever is), <br />would actually require that in order to enforce it, such a license would <br />clearly have to be a _contract_. If it's not distributed, it's not a <br />matter of copyright any more, it's very obviously a matter of mutual <br />agreement: "we give you source, you give us source back".<br /><br />Secondly, a lot of people use GPL code privately, with private <br />modifications, and you would see a lot more screaming than about the <br />current GPLv3 draft. So I think the FSF (correctly) decided that they <br />simply cannot do it.<br /><br />In fact, it's one of the very traditional ways of making money for some <br />Free Software projects: the whole way Cygnus supported itself was largely <br />to make "private" branches of GCC for various commercial vendors, and <br />while the vendors had the _right_ to distribute the sources, they also had <br />the right not to (and since they didn't want to, they wouldn't be <br />distributed).<br /><br />Does that sound against the spirit of "give back source"? Sure does. But <br />it's one of those things that the FSF has always supported, so they don't <br />see it as a huge problem, and since they don't want to limit _that_ kind <br />of usage, they automatically also cannot limit the ASP kind of usage which <br />really is exactly the same thing.<br /><br />So I actually think that an ASP clause would be totally unacceptable to a <br />lot of people, even more so than the stupid anti-Tivo clauses. And I think <br />the FSF realized that, and didn't even push it, even though they have been <br />talking about the "ASP hole" when they don't like it.<br /><br />So it really does boil down to a very simple end result (which is the <br />exact same deal that I think the whole anti-DRM problem has been about):<br /><br /> - Not everybody agrees about the current GPLv2<br /><br /> - But trying to extend the reach of it just causes more (fundamental) <br />   problems than the problems such extensions would try to fix.<br /><br />So I'd like to repeat: the reason the GPLv2 is wonderful is exactly the <br />fact that it's so widely applicable, and useful for such a wide audience. <br />That _does_ mean that it will inevitably have to accept a certain level of <br />bad behaviour by selfish people, but since you can't distribute the <br />derived work without distributing the source code, you're guaranteed that <br />the bad behaviour cannot "procreate". <br /><br />In other words: if you think of open source development as a kind of <br />"sexual reproduction" (it really does have a lot of analogies - it's a <br />"memetic recombination and survival of the fittest"), any "bad use" by <br />definition is a dead end. You can be bad, but a bad use is always a <br />eunuch, and as such doesn't matter in the long run. The only way you can <br />actually make a _difference_ is by participating constructively.<br /><br />In other words: I do agree that the "ASP hole" is a hole, but exactly as <br />with all the Tivo issues, it's a hole that needs to be there simply <br />because trying to plug it would cause disaster.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
