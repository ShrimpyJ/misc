There's nothing to really say that you need to state your <br />copyright license in every individual file, especially if those files are <br />only ever distributed as a whole, together with other things (which souce <br />code obviously is - you generally cannot even use an individual *.c file <br />without the infrastructure it was written for).<br /><br />If a file doesn't have a license mentioned, it doesn't mean that it's <br />"free for all" or not copyrighted, it just means that you need to find out <br />what the license is some other way (and if you can't find out, you <br />shouldn't be copying that file ;)<br /><br />Of course, for clarity, a lot of projects end up adding at least a minimal <br />copyright header license everywhere, just to cover their *sses. It's not <br />required, but maybe it avoids some confusion, especially if that file is <br />later copied into some other project with other basic rules (but if you <br />do that, you really _should_ have added the information at that point!).<br /><br />Me personally, I prefer to not see huge boiler-plate licenses at the top <br />of the file, so that every time I open a new file I just see the dang <br />license that has nothing to do with why I'm opening it. So I tend to do a <br />fairly minimal thing ("Copyright (C) Linus Torvalds 2006" or similar) but <br />sometimes I drop even that (ie I personally feel silly adding a copyright <br />message to a header file, so I usually don't - and sometimes I just <br />forget about it in real source files too)..<br /><br />Others are more anal^H^H^H^Hcareful, and tend to add a few lines to tell <br />what the license is, the ubiqutous "all rights reserved" (which is just <br />idiocy), and a blinking gif advertisement for their company. Oh, and the <br />"no warranty" clause. And an aphorism or two.<br /><br />In other words, I don't think there are any real rules. Different people <br />and different projects have more or less different rules. If you expect to <br />collect treble damages in the US, you might want to add a copyright notice <br />just about everywhere, "just in case", and to "show you really care".<br /><br />IANAL, of course.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
