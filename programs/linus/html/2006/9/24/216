But if _you_ make such<br />&gt; a statement yourself (even if it's based on his conclusions) then<br />&gt; you better accept that people who disagree will respond to your statement.<br /><br />I think it's unquestionable that sometimes it's better to work with <br />patches. The thing is, git by its very design is about tracking things <br />where history is firmly "set in stone", and that's not always what you <br />want.<br /><br />We've done a number of things to help people relax that a bit (notably <br />"git rebase" and "git cherry-pick"), and there are projects like stgit <br />that are more of a patch-management system on top of git, but even during <br />the early design phases I said that it's likely that git will be used in <br />_conjunction_ with tools like quilt etc, that are less strict than git is.<br /><br />So I don't think we need to attack the notion of using non-git tools at <br />all. Especially if you don't know where you're going, git's very strict <br />immobile history can be a bit daunting.<br /><br />(Of course, once you get really used to git, you use git _anyway_, and <br />then you use cherry-pick and other tools to re-write a cleaned-up version <br />of the thing that you originally screwed up because you didn't know what <br />you were doing. So you _can_ do this too with git, but that doesn't mean <br />that git would necessarily be the best way to do it).<br /><br />That said, maybe we could help the "fixup" phases evenmore using git. For <br />example, right now you can do "git cherry-pick" to transfer individual <br />patches, but if you want to combine two commits while cherry-picking, it <br />immediately gets more involved (still quite doable: use cherry-pick <br />multiple times with the "-n" flag, but it's not as obvious any more).<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
