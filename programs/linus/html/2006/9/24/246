data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></td></tr></table><pre itemprop="articleBody"><br />One of the reasons I didn't end up signing the GPLv3 position statement <br />that James posted (and others had signed up for), was that a few weeks ago <br />I had signed up for writing another kind of statement entirely: not so <br />much about why I dislike the GPLv3, but why I think the GPLv2 is so great.<br /><br />(There were other reasons too, but never mind that.)<br /><br />I didn't get my fat arse off the ground on that, partly exactly because <br />the developer poll of "which is better" which was related to that issue <br />distracted me, but mostly because I just seldom write that kind of text - <br />one thing the kernel work has conditioned me for is that I write _replies_ <br />to email, I seldom start threads myself (I suspect most of my emails on <br />linux-kernel that aren't replies are just release announcements).<br /><br />However, since there was a sub-thread on groklaw about the kernel <br />developers opinions on the GPLv3, and since I did try to explain it there <br />(as a reply to postings by PJ and others), and since some of those <br />explanations ended up being exactly the "why the GPLv2 is so insanely <br />great" that I never wrote otherwise, I thought I'd just repost that <br />explanation as an alternative view.<br /><br />So this post is kind of another way to look at the whole GPLv3 issues: not <br />caring so much about why the GPLv3 is worse, but a much more positive "Why <br />the GPLv2 is _better_". I suspect some people may have an easier time <br />seeing and reading that argument, since it's not as contentious.<br /><br />A lot of people seem to think that the GPLv2 is showing its age, but I <br />would argue otherwise. Yes, the GPLv2 is "old" for being a copyright <br />license, but it's not even that you don't want to mess with something that <br />works - it's that it very fundamentally is such a good license that <br />there's not a whole lot of room for fixing aside from pure wording issues.<br /><br />So without further ado, here's my personal "reply" to the the GPLv3 <br />position statement. It's obviously not meant to repudiate James' text in <br />any way, it's just an alternate view on the same questions..<br /><br />I made other posts in the same thread on Groklaw thread, not as positive, <br />and not perhaps as worthy and quotable. This one may be a bit out of <br />context, but I do think it stands on its own, and you can see the full <br />thread in the "GPL Upheld in Germany Against D-Link" discussions on <br />Groklaw. The particular sub-thread was on what happens since we can't <br />easily change update the license, called "So What is the Future Then?"<br /><br />(I'd like to point to the groklaw posts, but there doesn't seem to be any <br />way to point to a particular comment without getting "The URL from Hell", <br />so it's easier to just duplicate it here).<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />---<br /><br />And thus spake PJ in response:<br />   "GPLv2 is not compatible with the Apache license.  It doesn't cover<br />    Bitstream.  It is ambiguous about web downloads.  It allows Tivo to<br />    forbid modification.  It has no patent protection clause.  It isn't<br />    internationally useful everywhere, due to not matching the terms of<br />    art used elsewhere.  It has no DMCA workaround or solution.  It is<br />    silent about DRM."<br /><br />Exactly!<br /><br />That's why the GPLv2 is so great.  Exactly because it doesn't bother or<br />talk about anything else than the very generic issue of "tit-for-tat". <br /><br />You see it as a failure.  I see it as a huge advantage.  The GPLv2 covers <br />the only thing that really matters, and the only thing that everybody can <br />agree on ("tit-for-tat" is really something everybody understands, and <br />sees the same way - it's totally independent of any moral judgement and <br />any philosophical, cultural or economic background).<br /><br />The thing is, exactly because the GPLv2 is not talking about the details, <br />but instead talks entirely about just a very simple issue, people can get <br />together around it.  You don't have to believe in the FSF or the tooth <br />fairy to see the point of the GPLv2.  It doesn't matter if you're black or <br />white, commercial or non-commercial, man or woman, an individual or a <br />corporation - you understand tit-or-tat.<br /><br />And that's also why legal details don't matter.  Changes in law won't <br />change the notion of "same for same".  A change of language doesn't change <br />"Quid pro quo".  We can still say "quid pro quo" two thousand years later, <br />in a language that has been dead for centuries, and the saying is still <br />known by any half-educated person in the world.<br /><br />And that's exactly because the concept is so universal, and so <br />fundamental, and so basic.<br /><br />And that is why the GPLv2 is a great license.<br /><br />I can't stress that enough.  Sure, other licenses can say the same thing, <br />but what the GPLv2 did was to be the first open-source license that made <br />that "tit-for-tat" a legal license that was widely deployed. That's <br />something that the FSF and rms should be proud of, rather than trying to <br />ruin by adding all these totally unnecessary things that are ephemeral, <br />and depend on some random worry of the day.<br /><br />That's also why I ended up changing the kernel license to the GPLv2. The <br />original Linux source license said basically: "Give all source back, and <br />never charge any money".  It took me a few months, but I realized that the <br />"never charge any money" part was just asinine.  It wasn't the point.  <br />The point was always "give back in kind".<br /><br />Btw, on a personal note, I can even tell you where that "never charge any <br />money" requirement came from.  It came from my own frustrations with Minix <br />as a poor student, where the cost of getting the system ($169 USD back <br />then) was just absolutely prohibitive.  I really disliked having to spend <br />a huge amount of money (to me) for something that I just needed to make my <br />machine useful.<br /><br />In other words, my original license very much had a "fear and loathing" <br />component to it.  It was exactly that "never charge any money" part. But I <br />realized that in the end, it was never really about the money, and that <br />what I really looked for in a license was the "fairness" thing.<br /><br />And that's what the GPLv2 is.  It's "fair".  It asks everybody - <br />regardless of circumstance - for the same thing.  It asks for the effort <br />that was put into improving the software to be given back to the common <br />good.  You can use the end result any way you want (and if you want to use <br />it for "bad" things, be my guest), but we ask the same exact thing of <br />everybody - give your modifications back.<br /><br />That's true grace.  Realizing that the petty concerns don't matter, <br />whether they are money or DRM, or patents, or anything else.<br /><br />And that's why I chose the GPLv2.  I did it back when the $169 I paid for <br />Minix still stung me, because I just decided that that wasn't what it was <br />all about.<br /><br />And I look at the additions to the GPLv3, and I still say: "That's not <br />what it's all about".<br /><br />My original license was petty and into details.  I don't need to go back <br />to those days.  I found a better license.  And it's the GPLv2.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
