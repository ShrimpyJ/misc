Even a lot of PC's have that: a lot (most?) PC's <br />&gt; &gt; have a flash that has a separate _hardware_ pin that says that it is <br />&gt; &gt; (possibly just partially) read-only. So in order to upgrade it, you'd <br />&gt; &gt; literally need to open the case up, set a jumper, and _then_ run the <br />&gt; &gt; program to reflash it.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I think this is history. Yes, late 486s and Pentiums (60 and 66?)<br />&gt; had a jumper protecting the flash. It's not true since ca. "Pentium 75+"<br />&gt; days - while many boards use "bootblock" chips, it's (almost?) always<br />&gt; unprotected (at most it just requires setting some GPIO pin(s)). The<br />&gt; rest of flash obviously has to be R/W to support the ESCD etc.<br /><br />You're probably right. The pin still exists on the flash chips, but most <br />of the time on PC's at least the writability is software-controlled.<br /><br />I think the hatred of pins became so high that it became almost <br />unacceptable for motherboard designers to add them on PC's. Nobody wants <br />to open their case any more ;)<br /><br />But the whole point was to just show how silly the whole "upgradable" vs <br />"not upgradable" discussion is. We're literally talking about something <br />where apparently it matters to the GPLv3 whether a pin on a chip is <br />connected to software or hardware (or not at all). Is that sane?<br /><br />So if it's "hardware-controlled", it would be ok (because it's not meant <br />to be upgraded at all)? But if it's software-controlled it is not? A set <br />of rules that require this kind of nitpicking is just broken.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
