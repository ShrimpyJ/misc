There has been<br />&gt; &gt;      the FSF position, and there has been the open source position, and<br />&gt; &gt;      the two have been very clearly separated.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; But whats wrong with that? The FSF is a "project" (or really, a group<br />&gt; of projects, because some FSF projects don't agree with the FSF<br />&gt; position either), it isn't them official voice of the community.<br /><br />Right, I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with having two <br />positions.<br /><br />In many ways, I'm saying the opposite. I'm saying that we should _expect_ <br />people to have different opinions. Everybody has their own opinion anyway, <br />and expecting people not have different opinions (especially programmers, <br />who are a rather opinionated lot in the first place) is just not <br />realistic.<br /><br />There's absolutely nothing wrong with having a very wide consensus among a <br />very varied developer base. In fact, I think that's _great_.<br /><br />And the reason I'm speaking out against the GPLv3 is that it is trying to <br />"sort the chaff from the wheat". The FSF is apparently not happy with a <br />wide community appeal - they want _their_ standpoint to be the one that <br />matters.<br /><br />I have all through the "discussion" tried to explain that the great thing <br />about the GPLv2 is that it allows all these people with totally different <br />ideals to come together. It doesn't have to be "perfect" for any <br />particular group - it's very perfection comes not from it's language, but <br />the very fact that it's _acceptable_ to a very wide group.<br /><br />When the FSF tries to "narrow it down", they kill the whole point of it. <br />The license suddenly is not a thing to get around and enjoy, it's become a <br />weapon to be used to attack the enemy.<br /><br />Here in the US, the only watchable TV news program is "The Daily Show" <br />with Jon Stewart. One of his fairly recurring themes is about how US <br />politics is destroyed by all these passionate and vocal extremists, and he <br />asks whether there can ever be a really passionate moderate. "Can you be <br />passionate about the middle road?"<br /><br />Dammit, I want to be a "Passionate Moderate". I'm passionate about just <br />people being able to work together on the same license, without this <br />extremism.<br /><br />So here's my _real_ cry for freedom:<br /><br /> "It's _ok_ to be commercial and do it just for money. And yes, you can <br />  even have a FSF badge, and carry Stallmans manifesto around everywhere <br />  you go. And yes, we accept people who like cryptography, and we accept <br />  people who aren't our friends. You don't have to believe exactly like we <br />  believe!"<br /><br />And for fifteen years, the GPLv2 has been a great umbrella for that. <br /><br />The FSF is throwing that away, because they don't _want_ to work with <br />people who don't share their ideals. <br /><br />&gt; &gt;      At the same time, both camps have been trying to be somewhat polite,<br />&gt; &gt;      as long as the fact that the split does clearly exist doesn't<br />&gt; &gt;      actually _matter_.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I agree. It doesn't matter because everyone is free to use whatever<br />&gt; version they want of the GPL. Of course, people do also recognize that<br />&gt; the GPL2 vs GPL3 argument is just a more subtle version of whats been<br />&gt; going on for years with BSD vs GPL.<br /><br />That's part of what really gets my goat. I spent too much time arguing <br />with crazy BSD people who tried to tell me that _their_ license was "true <br />freedom". The FSF shills echo those old BSD cries closely - even though <br />they are on the exact opposite side of the spectrum on the "freedom" part. <br /><br />I hated BSD people who just couldn't shut up about their complaining about <br />my choice of license back then (the good old BSD/MIT vs GPL flamewars). <br /><br />&gt; &gt;                      In fact, most programmers _still_ probably<br />&gt; &gt;      don't care. A lot of people use a license not because they "chose"<br />&gt; &gt;      it, but because they work on a project where somebody else chose the<br />&gt; &gt;      license for them originally.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Programmers don't care because we aren't lawyers. I mean, few things<br />&gt; are stated so simply, but lets face it, law is boring to quite a few<br />&gt; geeks, and the intersection between geeks who code and geeks who law<br />&gt; is very small.<br /><br />I think a _lot_ of programmers care very deeply indeed about the licenses. <br />I certainly do. I wouldn't want to be a lawyer, but I care about how my <br />code gets used.<br /><br />That said, I don't care how everybody _elses_ code gets used, which is <br />apparently one of the differences between me and rms.<br /><br />&gt; &gt; Not really. It wasn't even news. The kernel has had the "v2 only" thing<br />&gt; &gt; explicitly for more than half a decade, and I have personally tried to<br />&gt; &gt; make it very clear that even before that, it never had anything else (ie<br />&gt; &gt; it very much _had_ a specific license version, just by including the damn<br />&gt; &gt; thing, and the kernel has _never_ had the "v2 or any later" language).<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Wasn't that just to prevent the FSF from going evil and juping all your code?<br /><br />Well, initially it wasn't even a conscious "I don't trust the FSF" thing. <br />But when I chose the GPL (v2, back then) I chose _that_ license. There was <br />absolutely no need for me to say "or later". If the GPLv2 ever really <br />turns out to be a bad license, we can re-license _then_.<br /><br />Yes, it would be really really painful, but I think the "or later" wording <br />is worse. How can you _ever_ sign anything sight unseen? That's just <br />stupid, and that's totally regardless of any worries about the FSF.<br /><br />Later, when I did start having doubts about the FSF, I just made it even <br />more clear, since some people wondered.<br /><br />&gt; The only problem is that, alternatively, the FOSS movement was so<br />&gt; strong because of RMS's kool-aid everyone drank. The community has<br />&gt; teeth, and this is in partly because of the actions of the FSF. We<br />&gt; defend ourselves when we need to.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Its just that, at least with the Tivo case, that the defense went a tad too<br />&gt; far.<br /><br />I think the FSF has always alienated as many (or more) people as they <br />befriended, but maybe that's just me. I was looking for old newsgroup <br />threads about this earlier in the week, and noticed somebody in the BSD <br />camp saying that I was using the GPL, but that I wasn't as radical as rms. <br />And iirc, that was from 1993, when Linux was virtually unknown.<br /><br />So I think that not being too extreme is a _good_ thing. It's how you can <br />get more people involved.<br /><br />So everybody - join the "Passionate Moderate" movement, even if you're not <br />in the US. We're not passionate about any of the issues, we are just <br />_really_ fed up with extreme opinions! And we're not afraid to say so!<br /><br />[ The really sad part is: that was only _somewhat_ in jest. Dammit, <br />  sometimes I think we really need that party! ]<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
