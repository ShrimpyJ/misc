After all, the userland is not only GPL, but also BSD and <br />&gt; other stuff.<br /><br />Indeed.<br /><br />We have no trouble at all running programs with much worse licenses than <br />the GPLv3 (ie commercial programs). There is no problem with user space <br />being v3.<br /><br />&gt; &gt;The last Q. is how good is the almost forgotten Hurd kernel?<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Wild guess: At most on par with Minix.<br /><br />...and here's a thing that most people forget: good code simply doesn't <br />care about ideology, and ideology often does the wrong technical decisions <br />because it's not about practical issues.<br /><br />The watch-word in Linux development has been "pragmatism". That's probably <br />part of what drives the FSF wild about Linux in the first place. I care <br />about _practical_ issues, not about wild goose chases.<br /><br />If I weren't into computers, I'd be in science. And the rules in science <br />are the same: you simply can't do good science if you start with an <br />agenda. If you say that you'll never touch high-energy physics because <br />you find the atom bomb to be morally reprehensible, that's your right, but <br />you have to also realize that then you can never actually understand the <br />world, and do everything you may need to do.<br /><br />I've often compared Open Source development vs proprietary development to <br />science vs witchcraft (or alchemy).<br /><br />In many ways, the GPLv3 is about "religion". They limit the technology <br />because they are afraid of it. It's not that different from a religious <br />standpoint that some research is "bad" - because it undermines the <br />religious beliefs of the people. You'll find extremists in the US saying <br />that things like evolution is an affront to very basic human morals, the <br />exact same way that rms talks about DRM being "evil".<br /><br />I want to be a "scientist". I want people to be able to repeat the <br />experiments, logic, and measurements (that's very much what science is <br />about - you don't just trust people saying that the world works some way), <br />but being a scientist doesn't mean that you should let other scientists <br />into your own laboratory or into your own home. That would be just crazy <br />talk.<br /><br />So as a "scientist", I describe in sufficient detail my theory and the <br />results, so that anybody else in the world can replicate them. But they <br />can replicate them in their _own_ laboratories, thank you very much.<br /><br />That's what open source is all about. It's about _scientific_ ideals. <br />It's not on a moral crusade, and it never has been. <br /><br />The point behind all this: even if the Hurd didn't depend on Linux code <br />(and as far as I know, it does, but since I think they have their design <br />heads firmly up their *sses anyway with that whole microkernel thing, I've <br />never felt it was worth my time even looking at their code), I don't <br />believe a religiously motivated development community can ever generate as <br />good code except by pure chance.<br /><br />				Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
