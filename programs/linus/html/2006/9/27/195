But also somethign much more fundamental:<br /><br />	Copyright Law - regardless of country<br /><br />You can claim anything you damn well want in a license, but in the end, <br />it's all about "derived works". If something is not a derived work, it <br />doesn't matter _what_ ownership rights you have, it's simply not an issue.<br /><br />So even if the kernel had a big neon sign that said "You're bound by this <br />license in user space too!" (or, more likely, didn't have a sign at all, <br />like was the case originally), that has absolutely _zero_ legal meaning <br />for a copyright license. A license cannot cover something just because it <br />"says so".<br /><br />For example, I could write a copyright license that said<br /><br />	"This license forbids you from ever copying the kernel, or any <br />	work made by Leo Tolstoy, which is just a pseudonym for the<br />	easter bunny"<br /><br />and the fact that the license claims to control the works of Leo "the <br />easter bunny" Tolstoy, claiming so simply doesn't make it so.<br /><br />And yes, the above is obviously ridiculous, but the point is, it's no more <br />ridiculous than a license that would claim that it extends to programs <br />just because you can run then on Linux.<br /><br />In fact, it's also no more ridiculous than a license that claims it <br />extends copyright the other way - to the hardware or platform that you run <br />a program on. From a legal standpoint, such wording is just totally <br />idiotic.<br /><br />[ So the wording at the top of the license is a clarification of fact, not <br />  really any kind of change of the license itself. It actually does have <br />  some legal meaning (it shows "intent"), but most importantly it allows <br />  people to not have to even worry about frivolous lawsuits. Nobody can <br />  sue people for not running GPLv2 user-space through normal system calls, <br />  because the statement of intent makes it clear that a judge would throw <br />  out such a suit immediately.<br /><br />  So I think the important thing here to take away is that "frivolous" <br />  part of the lawsuit. The language doesn't actually _change_ the legal <br />  meaning, but it protects against idiots. And a lot of lawyers worry <br />  about idiots and money-grubbing douchebags *cough*SCO*cough*, and<br />  as such obvious clarifications _can_ be useful. ]<br /><br />Another real-world example of this mis-understanding is that a lot of <br />people seem to think that the GPLv2 disallows "linking" with non-GPLv2 <br />code. Almost everybody I ever meet say that, and the FSF has written long <br />pieces on shared libraries etc.<br /><br />People don't have a clue!<br /><br />The GPLv2 never _ever_ mentions "linking" or any other technical measure <br />at all. Doing so would just be stupid (another problem with the GPLv3, <br />btw). So people who think that the GPLv2 disallows "linking" with <br />non-GPLv2 code had better go back and read the license again.<br /><br />Grep for it, if you want to. The word "link" simply DOES NOT EXIST IN THE <br />LICENSE!<br /><br />(It does exist at the end of the _file_ that contains the license, but <br />that's not actually the license at all, it's just the "btw, this is how <br />you might _use_ the license", and while legally that can be used to show <br />"intent", it does not actually extend the copyright in the work in any <br />way, shape, or form).<br /><br />What the GPLv2 actually talks about is _only_ about "derived work". And <br />whether linking (dynamically, statically, or by using an army of worker <br />gnomes that re-arrange the bits to their liking) means something is <br />"derived or not" is a totally different issue, and is not something you <br />can actually say one way or the other, because it will depend on the <br />circumstances.<br /><br />I'm always surprised by how many people talk abut the GPLv2 (and, quite <br />frankly, about the GPLv3 draft) without actually seemingly having ever <br />read the damn thing, or, more likely, ever really understood any legal <br />stuff what-so-ever, or the difference between the _use_ of a license, and <br />the license itself.<br /><br />For example, in the GPLv3 discussions, I've seen more than one person <br />claim that I've used a special magic version of the GPLv2 that doesn't <br />have the "v2 or any later" clause. Again, those people don't have a _clue_ <br />about what they are talking about. They feel very free in arguing about <br />other peoples copyrigted works, and the fact that I'm not a lawyer, but <br />then they ignore the fact that I actually _do_ know what I'm talking <br />about, and that they don't have a stinking clue.<br /><br />&gt; No. The definition of a derivative work is a legal one and not a<br />&gt; technical one.<br /><br />Exactly. A lot of people don't understand this, and a lot of people think <br />that "derivative" means "being close". Linking doesn't make something <br />derivative per se - the same way _not_ linking doesn't make it not be <br />derivative.<br /><br />Now, it is also indisputable that if you _need_ to "link", it's a damn <br />good sign that something is _very_likely_ to be derivative, but as Alan <br />points out, you could do the same thing with RPC over a socket, and the <br />fact that you did it technically differently really makes no real <br />difference. So linking per se isn't the issue, and never has been.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
