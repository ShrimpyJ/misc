Factory recall everytime you need to fix a<br />&gt; security/feature bug just costs too much<br /><br />Side note: it's not even about factory recalls, it's that flash chips are <br />literally cheaper than masked roms for almost all applications.<br /><br />Mask roms are expensive for several reasons:<br /><br /> - they force extra development costs on you, because you have to be <br />   insanely careful, since you know you're stuck with it.<br /><br />   So it's not even just the cost of the recall itself: it's the <br />   _opportunity_ cost of having to worry about it which tends to be the <br />   biggest cost by far. Most devices never get recalled, and when they do <br />   get recalled, a lot of people never bother about it. So the real cost <br />   is seldom the recall itself, it's just the expense of worrying about <br />   it, and wasting time on trying to make things "perfect" (which never<br />   really works anyway)<br /><br /> - during development, mask roms are a big pain in the ass, so you need to <br />   build all your development boards (even the very final one! The one <br />   that is supposedly identical to the released version!) with a flash <br />   anyway, even if you can only program it by setting a magic jumper or <br />   something.<br /><br />   So using a mask rom means that your development platform pretty much <br />   will never match the actual hw platform you sell. That's a DISASTER. <br />   It's like always developing and testing with the compiler using the <br />   "-g" flag, but then _shipping_ the binary with "-O". Nobody sane would <br />   ever do that - it just means that all your verification was basically<br />   useless.<br /><br /> - They force you to use a specialized chip. Mass production usually means <br />   that in any kind of low volumes, specialized chips are always going to <br />   be more expensive.<br /><br />   People seem to sometimes still believe that we live in the 1980's. Mask <br />   roms used to be relatively "cheaper", because it wasn't as much about <br />   standardized and huge volumes of chips. These people should please <br />   realize that technology has changed in the last quarter century, and <br />   we're not playing "pong" any more.<br /><br />[ Side note: is there a good "pong" box you can buy? I want pong and the <br />  real asteroids - the one with vector graphics. And I realize I can't <br />  afford the real asteroids, but dang, there should be a realistic pong<br />  somewhere? Some things are hard to improve on.. ]<br /><br />So even if you don't actually want to upgrade the machine, it's likely to <br />have a flash in it simply because it's often _cheaper_ that way. <br /><br />And it not at all uncommon to have a flash that simply cannot be upgraded <br />without opening the box. Even a lot of PC's have that: a lot (most?) PC's <br />have a flash that has a separate _hardware_ pin that says that it is <br />(possibly just partially) read-only. So in order to upgrade it, you'd <br />literally need to open the case up, set a jumper, and _then_ run the <br />program to reflash it.<br /><br />People do things like that for fail-safe reasons. For example, a portion <br />of the flash is read-only, just so that if a re-flashing fails, you have <br />the read-only portion that verifies the signature, and if it doesn't <br />match, it contains enough basic logic that you can try to re-flash again.<br /><br />Those kinds of fail-safes are absolutely _critical_, and I'm not talking <br />about some "hypothetical" device here. I'm talking very much about devices <br />that you and me and everybody else probably use every stinking day.<br /><br />In fact, I can pretty much guarantee that pretty much everybody who is <br />reading this is reading it on a machine that has an upgrade facility that <br />is protected by cryptographic means. Your CPU. Most of the microcode <br />updaters have some simple crypto in them (although sometimes that crypto <br />is pretty weak and I think AMD relies more on just not documenting the <br />format).<br /><br />Look into the Linux kernel microcode updater code some day, and please <br />realize that it talks to one of those evil "DRM-protected devices".<br /><br />And dammit, this is all OK. If people want to write a GPL'd microcode <br />update, they damn well should be able to. Oh, but the GPLv3 forbids them <br />from doing that without giving out the keys used to sign the result.<br /><br />	"But that's ok, because the FSF is looking out for all of us, and<br />	 we know mommy knows best."<br /><br />So it's all good.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
