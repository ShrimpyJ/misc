The<br />&gt; &gt; FSF has simply chosen not to listen to Linus and other members of the<br />&gt; &gt; kernel community.  In fact, I've never seen any interest in a<br />&gt; &gt; dialogue, just a pseudo-dialogue where "input is solicited", and then<br />&gt; &gt; as near as far as I can tell, at least on the anti-Tivo issue, has<br />&gt; &gt; been simply ignored.  But in any case, it should not have come as a<br />&gt; &gt; surprise and should not have startled anyone.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Perhaps I came off too strong, but I meant what I said, and I'm not only<br />&gt; talking about things being made clear with Eben and the FSF. Frankly, I don't<br />&gt; know what did or did not happen behind closed doors and it would be wrong of<br />&gt; me to make assumptions about that.<br /><br />I think a lot of people may be confused because what they see is<br /><br /> (a) Something that has been brewing for a _loong_ time. There has been <br />     the FSF position, and there has been the open source position, and <br />     the two have been very clearly separated.<br /><br />     At the same time, both camps have been trying to be somewhat polite, <br />     as long as the fact that the split does clearly exist doesn't <br />     actually _matter_.<br /><br />     So, for example, the GPLv2 has been acceptable to all parties (which <br />     is what I argue is its great strength), and practically you've not <br />     actually had to care. In fact, most programmers _still_ probably <br />     don't care. A lot of people use a license not because they "chose" <br />     it, but because they work on a project where somebody else chose the <br />     license for them originally.<br /><br />     This, btw, is probably why some things matter to me more than many <br />     other kernel developers. I'm the only one who really had an actual <br />     choice of licenses. Relatively, very few other people ever had to <br />     even make that choice, and as such, I suspect that a number of people <br />     just feel that it wasn't their choice in the first place and that <br />     they don't care that deeply.<br /><br />     Ted is actually likely one of the very few people who were actually <br />     involved when the choice of GPLv2 happened, and is in the almost <br />     unique situation of probably having an email from me asking if he was <br />     ok with switching from my original license to the GPLv2. Ted?<br /><br />     So we have something that has been going on for more than a decade <br />     (the actual name of "Open Source" happened in 1998, but it wasn't <br />     like the _issues_ with the FSF hadn't been brewing before that too), <br />     but that has mostly been under the surface, because there has been no <br />     _practical_ reason to react to it.<br /><br /> (b) This tension and the standpoints of the two sides has definitely <br />     _not_ been unknown to the people involved. Trust me, the FSF knew <br />     very well that the kernel standpoint on the GPLv2 was that Tivo was <br />     legally in the right, and that it was all ok in that sense.<br /><br />     Now, a number of people didn't necessarily _like_ what Tivo does or <br />     how they did it, but the whole rabid "this must be stopped" thing was <br />     from the FSF side. <br /><br />&gt; What I was really addressing here is that the whole F/OSS community <br />&gt; exploded over the news that Linux was not adopting the GPLv3.<br /><br />Not really. It wasn't even news. The kernel has had the "v2 only" thing <br />explicitly for more than half a decade, and I have personally tried to <br />make it very clear that even before that, it never had anything else (ie <br />it very much _had_ a specific license version, just by including the damn <br />thing, and the kernel has _never_ had the "v2 or any later" language).<br /><br />So legally, Linux has generally been v2-only since 1992, and just to head <br />off any confusion, it's even been very explicit for the last five years.<br /><br />So what's the "news" really?<br /><br />I'll tell you what the news is: the FSF was going along, _as_if_ they had <br />the support of not just their own supporters, but the OSS community too, <br />even though they knew _full_well_ what the differences were.<br /><br />In fact, a lot of people have felt that they've been riding of the <br />coat-tails of Linux - without ever realizing that one of the things that <br />made Linux and Open Source so successful was exactly the fact that we did <br />_not_ buy into the rhetoric and the extremism.<br /><br />Claiming that the FSF didn't know, and that this took them "by surprise" <br />is just ludicrous. Richard Stallman has very vocally complained about the <br />Open Source people having "forgotten" what was important, and has talked <br />about me as if I'm some half-wit who doesn't understand the "real" issue.<br /><br />In fact, they still do that. Trying to explain the "mis-understanding". <br /><br />It was _never_ a mis-understanding. And I think the only surprise here was <br />not how the kernel community felt, but the fact that Richard and Eben had <br />probably counted on us just not standing up for it.<br /><br />THAT is the surprise. The fact that we had the _gall_ to tell them that <br />we didn't agree with them.<br /><br />The fact that we didn't agree was not a surprise at all.<br /><br />&gt; I think it's fair to say that the reason why Linux is not adopting GPLv3 <br />&gt; (aside from the very practical matter of gaining the consensus of <br />&gt; copyright holders) is that Linus and other top copyright holders don't <br />&gt; think what Tivo is doing is wrong.<br /><br />Well, I personally believe that Tivo did everything right, but in the <br />interest of full disclosure, sure, some people even _do_ belive that what <br />Tivo is doing is wrong, but pretty much everybody agrees that trying to <br />stop them is _worse_ than the thing it tries to fix.<br /><br />Because the even _deeper_ rift between the FSF and the whole "Open Source" <br />community is not over "Tivo" or any particular detail like that, but <br />between "practical and useful" and "ideology".<br /><br />And no, it's not a black-and-white issue. There are all kinds of shades of <br />gray, and "practical" and "ideology" aren't even mutually incompatible! <br />It's just that sometimes they say different things.<br /><br />And yes, I personally exploded, but hey, it's been brewing for over a <br />decade. Let me over-react sometimes. I'm still always right ;)<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
