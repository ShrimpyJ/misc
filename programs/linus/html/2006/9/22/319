This would at least begin to reduce this problem over the next<br />&gt; few years, leaving fewer and fewer people with claim to less and less code<br />&gt; who would have legal standing to object.<br /><br />It's the last thing I'd ever want to do, for all the same reasons the <br />kernel doesn't have the "or later versions" language wrt licenses.<br /><br />I don't actually want people to need to trust anybody - and that very much <br />includes me - implicitly.<br /><br />I think people can generally trust me, but they can trust me exactly <br />because they know they don't _have_ to.<br /><br />The reason the poll and the whitepaper got started was that I've obviously <br />not been all that happy with the GPLv3, and while I was pretty sure I was <br />not alone in that opinion, I also realize that _everybody_ thinks that <br />they are right, and that they are supported by all other right-thinking <br />people. That's just how people work. We all think we're better than <br />average.<br /><br />So while I personally thought it was pretty clear that the GPLv2 was the <br />better license for the kernel, I didn't want to just depend on my own <br />personal opinion, but I wanted to feel that I had actually made my best to <br />ask people.<br /><br />Now, I could have done it all directly on the Linux-kernel mailing list, <br />but let's face it, that would just have caused a long discussion and we'd <br />not have really been any better off anyway. So instead, I did<br /><br />	git log | grep -i signed-off-by: |<br />		cut -d: -f2- | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | less -S<br /><br />which anybody else can do on their copy of their git repository, and I <br />just picked the first screenful of people (and Alan. And later we added <br />three more people after somebody pointed out that some top people use <br />multiple email addresses so my initial filtering hadn't counted for them <br />properly).<br /><br />[ I also double-checked by just checking the same numbers for authorship.<br />  I'll very openly admit to thinking that the maintainership that goes <br />  with forwarding other peoples patches to me counts as almost as <br />  important as the authorship itself, which is why I started out with the <br />  signed-off-by count, but I also wanted to verify that the list of people <br />  makes sense either way. It did. ]<br /><br />In other words, maybe some people thought that the 29 names were somehow <br />"selected" to get that particular answer.  Nope. The only selection was <br />just an arbitrary cut-off-point (and the fact that I think two people <br />didn't actually vote).<br /><br />It wasn't meant to be really "definitive" - the poll was literally meant <br />to get _some_ kind of view into how the top developers feel. I think the <br />end result ended up being more definitive (just thanks to the very clear <br />voting pattern) than we migth have expected.<br /><br />So, to anybody not on the list - don't feel bad. This was about getting a <br />good _feeling_ for how the top kernel maintainers - judging purely by an <br />admittedly fairly arbitrary, but also very neutral, measure - felt about <br />the license.<br /><br />If the result had turned out very differently, I would probably have had <br />to seriously re-think my stance on the license. I don't guarantee that I <br />always change my mind, but I _can_ guarantee that if most of the people I <br />trust tell me I'm a dick-head, I'll at least give it a passing thought.<br /><br />[ Chorus: "You're a dick-head, Linus" ]<br /><br />Anyway, nobody got voted off the island. This was a poll, to get a view <br />into what people thought. Take it as such, and I think people will happily <br />discuss issues.<br /><br />Different people had different issues with the GPLv3, so the separate <br />white-paper that was written was done by a different group, and is meant <br />for a different reason - it talks about some of the issues those <br />particular people wanted to point out.<br /><br />My personal opinion is that a lot of the public discussion has been driven <br />by people who are motivated by the politics of the discussion. So you have <br />a lot of very vocal GPLv3 supporters. But I think that the people who <br />actually end up doing a lot of the development are usually not as vocal, <br />and haev actually not been heard very much at all.<br /><br />In some sense, the poll is a way for the people who actually do a lot of <br />the work to show that the FSF doesn't speak for necessarily even a very <br />big portion of actual developers.<br /><br />				Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
