Some trees do seem to get pulled more often than others.<br />&gt; Linus, is there a upper limit on the number of times you want<br />&gt; to see pull requests? It strikes me as odd, so I'm wondering<br />&gt; if there are some crossed wires here.<br /><br />I personally prefer to not see _too_ many pull requests, since that to me <br />indicates that people don't take advantage of the distributed nature of <br />git, and don't let things "simmer" in their own tree for a while.<br /><br />[ Side note, just to explain how I personally work: getting too many <br />  requests about the same tree confuses and sometimes irritates me, since <br />  I tend to "batch up" my work. For example, for the last couple of days, <br />  I've been mostly in "discussion mode", and have been talking about <br />  licenses and workflow issues etc.<br /><br />  And then at some point (probably later today) I decide to go into "merge <br />  mode" and go back to old mails I ignored and start applying them and <br />  pulling from other peoples git trees. And so if my "mode switching" has <br />  a longer latency than the "please pull" frequency, I end up seeing two <br />  requests for the same tree during the same "merge mode" thing, which <br />  just means that when I look at the older one, it no longer matches what <br />  is in the tree I'm pulling from.<br /><br />  I've long done this "batching" thing - it's something I eventually <br />  worked out with my patch-flow with Alan, and that I think we've <br />  perfected with Andrew (probably largely _because_ we worked it out with <br />  Alan after a certain amount of friction ;).<br /><br />  I personally at least _feel_ like I'm more efficient when I can just <br />  completely switch gears, rather than having a constant trickle of <br />  different things happening.<br /><br />  Hopefully that explains the other side of why I prefer to not get two <br />  pull requests for the same tree within days of each other - I may simply <br />  not even have gotten _around_ to the first one yet, and then the second <br />  one just irritates me. ]<br /><br />For example, I think that project maintainers should to some degree just <br />talk about their _own_ trees, rather than try to get their changes into my <br />tree, and then point to that. One of the big ideas in distribution (at <br />least to me) is that I'm _not_ supposed to be the "one and only", and I <br />think we should aim for a situation where people who develop in certain <br />specific areas can interact directly with the people who are testing the <br />results, so that by the time I get a "please pull" request, most of the <br />bulk of the work should hopefully already have gone through a cycle.<br /><br />And all this is not even really git-centric. It's obviously what Andrew <br />does with the -mm tree too - havign a certain amount of "latency" is good.<br /><br />That said, the "release early, release often" thing still holds, and <br />letting things wait _too_ long just means that the _only_ people who test <br />it is some very specific group, and you may not see the problems that a <br />bigger environment would see.<br /><br />So it's a balance between "by the time you send it on, it should hopefully <br />have had a day or two of testing" _and_ a "by the time you send it on you <br />shouldn't have forgotten the issues and think it's old and all done".<br /><br />I would _personally_ judge that if you need to push me the same tree more <br />than once a week (not counting mistakes and brown-paper bugs that <br />obviously happen - I'm saying "in general" here), there's likely something <br />strange going on.<br /><br />But at the same time, please do keep in mind thatr it's partly just a <br />matter of taste, and it's also very much a matter of work habits (and <br />about how active the tree is). Some people tend to work in certain ways.<br /><br />I think rmk keeps his git trees in a private location (and I think it's <br />because the kernel.org maintainers asked us to not mirror things out <br />publicly if we didn't need to), so I think part of the reason the ARM <br />trees get pushed out more actively is simply because Russell has used my <br />tree as a "distribution point".<br /><br />I don't think that's necessarily great, and there's been some friction <br />over it ("people are waiting for this"), but it's not been a _huge_ <br />problem either, so I just lump it in the "different people, different ways <br />to work" pile..<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
