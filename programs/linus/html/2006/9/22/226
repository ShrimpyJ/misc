I added Alan Cox to <br />the list, just because, but basically it's otherwise a totally unbiased <br />selection.<br /><br />And trust me when I say that we're an argumentative lot. Some people <br />consider the kernel mailing list to be somewhat argumentative at times, <br />but I think people are even more open in their opinions when they're <br />allowed to vent freely.<br /><br />And we certainly had some "heated discussion" over a number of details, <br />but as you can see from the actual votes, I think the conclusion people <br />had come to (regardless of their opinions on some issues) were more <br />uniform than you might have expected.<br /><br />I think a number of outsiders also believed that I personally was just the <br />odd man out, because I've been so publicly not a huge fan of the GPLv3.  <br /><br />So I think some people who see the results - especially people who haven't <br />been active in kernel development themselves - might be surprised to see <br />that I wasn't even an outlier in the kernel group.<br /><br />So I suspect your lack of surprise is because you've been on the kernel <br />mailing list for too long, and already know the personalities of the <br />people involved.<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
