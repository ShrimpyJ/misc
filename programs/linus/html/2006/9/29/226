I'm not giving legal advice, and am <br />just stating my own standpoint.<br /><br />I think people (especially in the US) tend to be way too lawsuit-happy <br />anyway, but I'm in no way trying to discourage people who feel they want <br />to assert rights that I personally don't think _I_ have. People differ in <br />their opinions of the rights they hold. That's ok.<br /><br />The way things _really_ get decided is not on the kernel mailing list, or <br />even by asking a lawyer, but by people who decided that some company or <br />other just simply crossed the line and did something illegal. My opinion <br />simply doesn't _matter_ in that sense.<br /><br />For example, when I say that I think it would be totally insane to think <br />that a 128-bit hash of a binary is a "derived work", I say that as a <br />concerned citizen. I think a world where real lawyers would say that would <br />be a _horrible_ world. And I don't think it makes sense. But sadly, until <br />I'm elected(*) life-time President and King of the World, what I think <br />doesn't actually change anything.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br />(*) Hah. Who do I think I'm kidding? The revolution will be bloody and <br />brutal, and you're not going to get the choice to "elect" me except in the <br />history books written by yours truly.<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
