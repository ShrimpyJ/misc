Sure, lasers and medical equipment is<br />&gt; dangerous if used wrong.  When such equipment is<br />&gt; controlled by software, then changing that software brings<br />&gt; huge responsibility.  But it shouldn't be made impossible.<br /><br />It may be "silly", but hey, it's often a law. <br /><br />Also, even if it wasn't about laws, there is a very valid argument that <br />you should be able to be silly. There's a reason people don't get locked <br />up in prisons just for being silly or crazy - sometimes something that <br />seems silly may turn out to be a great idea. <br /><br />And people seem to totally ignore that there is no correct answer to "who <br />may do software updates?". People rant and rave about companies that stop <br />_you_ from making software updates, but then they ignore the fact that <br />this also stops truly bad people from doing it behind your back.<br /><br />Quite frankly, in many situations, I'd sure as hell be sure that any <br />random person with physical access to a machine (even if it was mine, and <br />even if I'm _one_ of them) could not just upgrade a piece of software.<br /><br />Sometimes you can make those protections yourself (ie you add passwords, <br />and lock down the hardware - think of any University student computer <br />center or a library or something), but what a lot of people seem to <br />totally ignore is that often it's a hell of a lot more convenient for <br />_everybody_ if the vendor just does it.<br /><br />And no, the answer is not "just give the password to people who buy the <br />hardware". That requires individualized passwords, probably on a <br />per-machine basis. That's often simply not _practical_, or is just much <br />more expensive. It's quite natural for a vendor in this kind of situation <br />to just have one very secret private key per model or something like that.<br /><br />In other words, these secret keys that people rant against JUST MAKE <br />SENSE. Trying to outlaw the technology is idiotic, and shortsighted.<br /><br />If you don't want a machine that is locked down, just don't buy it. It's <br />that simple. But don't try to take the right away from others to buy that <br />kind of convenience.<br /><br />And yes, Tivo is exactly such a situation. It's damn convenient. I've got <br />two Tivo's myself (and yes - I actually paid full price for them. I was <br />given one of the original ones, but that's long since scrapped, and even <br />that one I paid the subscription fee myself). But you don't have to buy <br />them. You can build your own at any time, and it will probably be more <br />powerful.<br /><br />So people are trying to claim that something is "wrong", even though it <br />clearly is. The people arguing for "freedom" are totally ignoring my <br />freedom to buy stuff that is convenient, and ignore real concerns where <br />things like TPM etc actually can make a lot of sense.<br /><br />Can it be used for bad things? Sure. Knives are dangerous too, but that <br />doesn't make them "wrong" or something you shouldn't allow.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
