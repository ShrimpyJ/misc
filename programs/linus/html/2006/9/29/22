If <br />&gt; &gt; a license says "v2 or later", anybody who removes an explicit right <br />&gt; &gt; granted by the people who originally wrote and worked on the code is just <br />&gt; &gt; being a total a-hole.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; But isn't that the whole point - to replace v2 by v3?<br /><br />I'm sure it's the point for the FSF. Is it really the point for anybody <br />else? Everybody else is better off with the more permissive license..<br /><br />&gt; Now I know that is what you would prefer, but it seems obvious that it<br />&gt; isn't what the new FSF wants.<br />&gt; I would be very surprised if new versions of any FSF-control code is<br />&gt; available under v2 more than a few months after v3 becomes final.<br /><br />I suspect the FSF might well be _very_ careful here. If they move to "v3 <br />or later", they had better be damn sure somebody won't license-fork that <br />project, or they'll be left with nothing at all.<br /><br />So I would not be entirely surprised if projects remain "v2 or later" just <br />because it's to nobodys advantage to play chicken.<br /><br />But who knows..<br /><br />&gt; I don't see the urgency.  Why are you "screwed forever"?  You can<br />&gt; always take the last version that was available under a suitable<br />&gt; license and fork from there, just like OpenSSH did.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Sure: the longer you leave it the harder it will be to get critical<br />&gt; mass, but I don't see the need for it to be done immediately.<br /><br />It obviously doesn't have to be, but it gets a lot harder to do later, if <br />the project has any appreciable amount of real development.<br /><br />Of course, a lot of projects probably don't have that much. I haven't <br />followed, but I don't get the feeling that bash or fileutils have a huge <br />amount of constant changes..<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
