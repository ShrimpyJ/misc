No serious lawyer I <br />&gt;    have ever met is even ambiguous about this. There's just no question - <br />&gt;    people may not be happy about it, and iirc the FSF at some point tried <br />&gt;    to claim somethign else, but this really isn't all that controversial.<br /><br />Btw, clearly the GPLv2 requirements do say that the use may have to be <br />done certain ways. For example, if you actually embed keys in the binary <br />itself, that almost certainly means that they keys are part of the source, <br />and as such you need to make the keys available through other means and <br />rely on the "mere aggregation" clause.<br /><br />The same thing goes for things like signed images. It you sign an <br />individual binary, it can be argued that the private key was part of the <br />build process. It's really a pretty weak argument, but the whole point is <br />made moot by the fact that you don't actually _need_ any keys: you can <br />just control the bootloader instead.<br /><br />That one not a derived work, and is quite often even on a totally <br />different media: flash vs disk or similar. And once you have it do a <br />consistency check by just verifying the SHA1 of the aggregate media <br />separately, you don't actually have any keys to release, because there <br />simply _is_ no key that actually covers any GPLv2'd code.<br /><br />You can try to take it to some (il)logical extreme, and ask yourself <br />whether just even holding a 128-bit hash is a "derived work"?<br /><br />But I not only think you'd be laughed out of court on that one if you <br />claimed it was, I _really_ don't think you want to go there anyway. <br />Because if you think it is, then you're violating copyright law every time <br />you look up a CD in CDDB/fredb/whatever-it's-called-now, or any number of <br />other things. You don't want to try to strengthen copyrights to insane <br />levels (you'd also be getting rid of "fair use" if you do).<br /><br />In other words, if you _really_ care about "freedom" (just about any kind) <br />you should be _damn_ careful not to try to extend those copyright claims <br />of "derived work" too far. Because quite frankly, YOU are going to lose on <br />that one, and the RIAA is going to laugh at your sorry ass for helping <br />them prove their nonexistent point, and you would end up losing a lot <br />more "freedoms" than the ones you thought you were fighting for.<br /><br />So the point is, there's no reasonable disagreement what-so-ever that you <br />can use GPLv2 code for anything you damn well want, including secure <br />lock-down. I think the FSF has even said so in public. You have to release <br />_source_code_, but the GPLv2 never controlled the environment it was used <br />in.<br /><br />Of course, a lot of people who have played games with these kinds of <br />issues also did other things very wrong. So a number of vendors that did <br />something fishy have gotten nailed for real copyright infringement due to <br />the _other_ things they did.<br /><br />[ I'd also not be surprised if companies would decide to settle just to <br />  avoid a lawsuit - especially one that made it clear that they were <br />  sleazy even if they weren't perhaps actually doing anything actively <br />  illegal. So there's a damn good reason why companies often don't want to <br />  even toe _close_ to the line, and we should be happy about that. But we <br />  shouldn't try to claim rules that simply never existed. ]<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
