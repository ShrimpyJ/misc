Let's recall, a proprietary program that<br />&gt; combines/derives with GPL code makes the final binary GPL (and hence<br />&gt; the source, etc. and whatnot, don't stretch it). Question: The Linux<br />&gt; kernel does have GPL2 and GPL2+later combined, what does this make<br />&gt; the final binary?<br /><br />The final is always the most restricted license (or put another way: it's <br />the "biggest possible license that can be used for everything", but in <br />practice it means that non-restrictive licenses always lose out to their <br />more restrictive brethren).<br /><br />This is, btw, why BSD code combined with GPL code is always GPL, and never <br />the other way. It's not a "vote" depending on which one has more code. And <br />it's not a mixture.<br /><br />The GPLv2 is very much designed to always be the most restricted license <br />in any combination - because the license says that you cannot add any <br />restrictions (so if there _was_ a more restricted license, it would no <br />longer be compatible with the GPLv2, and you couldn't mix them at all in <br />the first place).<br /><br />So any time you have a valid combination of licenses, if anything is <br />"GPLv2 only", the final end result is inevitably "GPLv2 only".<br /><br />[ Btw, the same is true of the GPLv3 - very much by design in both cases. <br />  This is why you can _never_ combine a "GPLv2" work with a "GPLv3" work. <br /><br />  They simply aren't compatible. One or both must accept the others <br />  license restrictions, and since neither does, and the restrictions <br />  aren't identical, there is no way to turn one into the other, or turn <br />  them both into a wholly new "mixed" license. <br /><br />  So this is why the _only_ way you can mix GPLv2 and GPLv3 code is if the <br />  code was dual-licensed, ie we have the "v2 or later" kind of situation. ]<br /><br />Basic rule: licenses are compatible only if they are strict subsets of <br />each other, and you can only ever take rights _away_ when you relicense <br />something. You can never add rights - if you didn't get those rights in <br />the first place with the original license, they're simply not yours to <br />add.<br /><br />Otherwise, we could all buy the latest CD albums, and then relicense them <br />with more rights than you got (or we could take GPLv3 code and remove the <br />restrictions, and relicense it as BSD).<br /><br />So the reason you can't re-license the CD albums is that you don't even <br />have any license to re-distribute them at all, and as such there is <br />nothing for you to sublicense further. And the reason you cannot relicense <br />the GPLv2 is that it tells you that you can't add any new restrictions <br />when you re-distribute anything, and you obviously can't add any rights <br />that you didn't have.<br /><br />And, as usual: IANAL. But none of this is really even remotely <br />controversial.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
