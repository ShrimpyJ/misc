No serious lawyer I <br />   have ever met is even ambiguous about this. There's just no question - <br />   people may not be happy about it, and iirc the FSF at some point tried <br />   to claim somethign else, but this really isn't all that controversial.<br /><br />   So the whole "If you don't want to use all this handy free code" <br />   argument is simply WRONG. It's based on a premise that just isn't true. <br />   All that handy free code is perfectly usable for things like a secure <br />   terminal or something else that doesn't allow you to change its <br />   behaviour because of some load-time consistency check.<br /><br />   You cannot make a logical argument that as it's axiom takes something <br />   that is patently false. It may still be "logically consistent", but it <br />   has no _relevance_, since it has nothing to do with reality.<br /><br /> - It tries to equate the word "free" (which means so many things that it <br />   almost lacks meaning) with "not able to authenticate". Which is just <br />   one of hundreds of ways to read it, and it is extremely irritating how <br />   the FSF thinks that _its_ definition of the word free somehow trumps <br />   everybody elses.<br /><br />   We already had that discussion ten years ago, and it's why people who <br />   want to be clear in their speaking (and thinking) use the term "Open <br />   Source". Because the OSI rules generally speak about concrete things <br />   that mean only one thing, which means that they actually have a <br />   well-defined _meaning_ in any discussion between two parties.<br /><br />A lot of people seem to think that the problem with "free" was just the <br />confusion between "no cost" and "freedom". Those people seemed to never <br />really understand an even deeper problem in the whole FSF language use.<br /><br />In other words: anybody who wants to have a logical argument about the <br />real world needs to start with (a) acknowledging facts and (b) avoid using <br />words that may mean something else to the other side.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
