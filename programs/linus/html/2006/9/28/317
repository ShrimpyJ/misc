The word "link" simply DOES NOT EXIST IN THE <br />&gt; &gt;LICENSE!<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Hah then read LICENSE.LGPL!<br /><br />Thank you for proving my point.<br /><br />The part you quote aren't part of the license. They're in the same file, <br />but they are separate from the actual text of the license. It's called the <br />"preamble", and you should really realize what it means. <br /><br />The _license_ is the legal part. It's the thing between "terms and <br />conditions" and "end of terms and conditions".<br /><br />I like being right, but I hate being proven right quite so quickly.<br /><br />(Btw, the license you quoted wasn't even the GPL. The LGPL - which is a <br />totally different thing - _does_ indeed talk about "linking", but the part <br />you quoted wasn't even _in_ that license, so it was kind of doubly silly <br />to bring that part up, now wasn't it?)<br /><br />&gt; If the GPL does not mention linking at all, and therefore does not<br />&gt; really forbid it, why do we need an LGPL to allow linking then?<br /><br />Where did you learn logic?<br /><br />The GPL doesn't mention linking, because the GPL only talks about derived <br />works. The LGPL talks about linking, because it wants to _narrow_ its <br />scope from "derived works" to something smaller, and makes it clear that <br />even within a derived work, the technical thing of "linking" actually <br />consitutes a license boundary.<br /><br />However, the fact IN NO WAY logically implies the reverse is true. The <br />fact that you link (or not) _in_itself_ does not necessarily imply a <br />boundary of derived works.<br /><br />Your logic is so horribly flawed that it's not even funny. It's the same <br />thing as if you said<br /><br />  - Aristotle is a man<br />  - I am not Aristotle<br />  - Therefore I am not a man<br /><br />Please take a course in Logic 101.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />PS. Just so that you don't confuse things _again_, I'd like to repeat: <br />pretty much everybody would agree that linking is often a damn strong <br />reason to believe the things are related and probably derived works. But <br />it's not at all a logical conclusion, and it's not at all necessarily <br />always right. "Derived work" is a lot more complicated than that.<br /><br />Linking with a GPL'd version of a standard C library (ie a non-GPL'd <br />version would have worked equally well, and you just did it becasue you <br />didn't think) would be very possibly (even likely) not be considered to be <br />a "derived work", but "mere aggregation".<br /><br />Think about that for a moment.<br /><br />And realize that the reason people then use the LGPL is that with that <br />license, the question above never even comes up. So you're on much safer <br />ground, and you don't have to worry about crazy people suing you.<br /><br />A lot of legal stuff is not just to avoid illegal things, but to <br />_obviously_ avoid them.
