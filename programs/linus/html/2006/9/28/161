Copyright assign<br />&gt; my ***, thank you very much.<br /><br />Yeah, I don't see why the FSF does that. Or I kind of see why, but it has <br />always struck me as<br /> (a) against the whole point of the license<br />and<br /> (b) who the F*CK do they think they are?<br /><br />I refuse to just sign over any copyrights I have. I gave you a license to <br />use them, if you can't live with that, then go fish in somebody elses <br />pond.<br /><br />I had some code I tried to give to glibc back when I was doing Linux/axp, <br />since glibc was really in pretty sad shape in some areas. I think I had a <br />integer divide routine that was something like five times faster than the <br />one in glibc, and about a tenth of the size. Things like that. So I wanted <br />to give things back, but ended up just throwing in the towel and said "ok, <br />if they don't want the code, whatever..".<br /><br />If somebody pays me real bucks, I'll work for them, and I'm perfectly ok <br />with letting them own copyright in the end result (ie I've done commercial <br />software too, and I think it's only reasonable that since I did it for <br />pay, I don't own that software myself). But copyright assignments "just <br />because we want to control the end result"? No thank you.<br /><br />&gt; And that is in fact the primary reason, hacking gcc has been fun and I<br />&gt; would like to do more, from a purely technical point of view.  But<br />&gt; having to sign a large amount of legalese is the kind of thing I may<br />&gt; have to do for a job, and they pay me for it.  It is not the kind of<br />&gt; thing I do for fun.  No fun, no money - hell, why should I do<br />&gt; something like that?!?<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Thank you for not requiring copyright assignments, Linus.<br /><br />I _hate_ copyright assignments. Maybe it's a European thing.<br /><br />Of course, I also hate paperwork, so maybe it's just a "lazy" thing.<br /><br />			Linus</pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
