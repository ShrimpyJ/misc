People have to accept the GPLv2 (because the kernel as a <br />whole is GPLv2), but it's ok to then allow extended rights for certain <br />files. For example, some of the SCSI drivers were co-maintained with the <br />BSD's, so having those be dual-licensed was the only sane thing to do.<br /><br />(And the one you point to is basically co-maintained with X.org, so it <br />falls under the same situation).<br /><br />A pure GPLv3 contribution is obviously not compatible with a GPLv2, but if <br />anybody thought that the informal poll was in any way going to remove the <br />files that had "v2 or any later", then no. We'll very much continue to <br />have various dual-licensed code.<br /><br />(Some of the dual-licensing isn't even with open source licenses. Some <br />people release their code both under the GPLv2 _and_ separately they <br />license use their own code in a commercial product too. You just don't see <br />that as much in the kernel, since that "separation" tends to happen <br />outside, so by the time the code is integrated into the kernel, the <br />proprietary licensed version has already been split off).<br /><br />&gt; &gt; just picked the first screenful of people (and Alan. And later we added <br />&gt; &gt; three more people after somebody pointed out that some top people use <br />&gt; <br />&gt; Alan *is on top* of (old fashioned, gitless):<br />&gt; <br />&gt; $ for i in `find linux/drivers/`<br />&gt; do dd count=1 &lt;$i | grep &#64; | sed 's_[^&lt;]*&lt;\(.*&#64;.*\)&gt;[^&gt;]*_\1_g'<br />&gt; done | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | most<br /><br />Well, quite frankly, I don't think the copyright messages in the source <br />code is necessarily very good. Some people add them, most don't. <br /><br />But yes, for obvious reasons Alan was added _regardless_ of any counts.<br /><br />&gt; And what about linux/CREDITS ? Creating (even in the past) is also worth.<br /><br />And what about the old history from BK time? And what about a million <br />other ways? There's no "one" right answer, but I doubt you'll find any <br />really obviously better answers than the one I picked.<br /><br />In other words, yes, there are other ways to count things. This was a <br />poll. And I do think the list of people was a very good list, because <br />while the particular way it was generated (from current -git sources), I <br />did actually double-check it different ways (including my own gut feel, <br />and verifying that the "author" and "sign-off" lists roughtly matched, <br />etc)<br /><br />Btw, if it makes you feel any better, if you look at the old <br />linux-historic archive (which goes back another 3+ years), and do the same <br />statistics, it's quite impressive how similar the list would be (Alan <br />_did_ show up on that list on his own, btw).<br /><br />So I claim that my list of people is one of the better lists you can come <br />up with. <br /><br />The really arbitrary point was the cut-off, and I could have picked 50 or <br />a hundred people instead of just a screenful. That's not the point. It's a <br />poll, and I do claim it's statistically relevant.<br /><br />The _real_ thing I wanted to avoid was yet another poll where "loudmouth" <br />counted. I've seen enough of those, thank you very much. If I wanted a <br />poll where the only thing that counted was how much you love the FSF and <br />how willing you were to be vocal about it, I'd have gone to osnews or some <br />other random site.<br /><br />This poll was for the people who actually DO things, not just make <br />political noises about licensing.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br />----- End forwarded message -----<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
