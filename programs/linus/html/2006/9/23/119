Not that I have seen such code yet, but you <br />&gt; never know.<br /><br />Side note: in "git", we kind of discussed this. And because the project <br />was started when the whole GPL version discussion was already in bloom, <br />the git project has a note at top of the COPYING file that says:<br /><br /> Note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as this project<br /> is concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not<br /> v2.2 or v3.x or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.<br /><br /> HOWEVER, in order to allow a migration to GPLv3 if that seems like<br /> a good idea, I also ask that people involved with the project make<br /> their preferences known. In particular, if you trust me to make that<br /> decision, you might note so in your copyright message, ie something<br /> like<br /><br />        This file is licensed under the GPL v2, or a later version<br />        at the discretion of Linus.<br /><br />  might avoid issues. But we can also just decide to synchronize and<br />  contact all copyright holders on record if/when the occasion arises.<br /><br />but note how it's still at the discretion of the actual developers (ie <br />when you add a file, you can either not specify any extensions, in which <br />case it's "GPLv2 only", or you can specify "GPLv2 or any later", or you <br />can specify the "GPLv2 or any later at the discretion of Linus Torvalds".<br /><br />The silly thing, of course, is that I'm not even the maintainer any more, <br />and that Junio has done a kick-ass job of maintaining the thing, and is <br />definitely the main author by now. So the whole "discretion of Linus" is a <br />bit insane.<br /><br />[ Although exactly _because_ Junio has been such a great maintainer, I'd <br />  bow down to whatever decision he does, so my "discretion" would be to <br />  let him decide, if he wanted to. At some point, you have to trust some <br />  people, and just let go - if they do more than you do, they damn well <br />  have more rights than you do too. "Maintainership has its privileges" ]<br /><br />Anyway, I suspect the git language was a mistake. We should just have done <br />what the kernel did - make the version number be clear and fixed, so that <br />people don't even have to worry about exactly what conditions might cause <br />a relicensing to happen.<br /><br />				Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
