I'll fix the wrong error handling.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I'm not sure reverting the patch solves the ACPI problem<br />&gt; because Michael's kernel seems not having any user of<br />&gt; bd_claim_by_kobject.<br /><br />Yeah, doing a grep does seem to imply that there is no way that those <br />changes could matter.<br /><br />Michael, can you double-check? I think Jun'ichi is right - in your kernel, <br />according to the config posted on bugzilla, I don't think there should be <br />a single caller of bd_claim_by_disk, since CONFIG_MD is disabled.<br /><br />So it does seem strange. But if you bisected to that patch, and it <br />reliably does _not_ have problems with the patch reverted, maybe there is <br />some strange preprocessor thing that makes "grep" not find the caller.<br /><br />Michael, you also reported:<br /><br />&gt; Reset to d7dd8fd9557840162b724a8ac1366dd78a12dff seems to hide part of <br />&gt; the issue (I have ACPI after kernel build, but not after <br />&gt; suspend/resume).  Both reverting this patch, and reset to the parent of<br />&gt; this patch seem to solve (or at least, hide) both problems for me (no <br />&gt; ACPI after suspend/resume and no ACPI after kernel build).<br /><br />(where that "d7dd8f.." is actually missing the initial "4" - I think you <br />cut-and-pasted things incorrectly). <br /><br />So I wonder.. You still had ACPI working _after_ the kernel build even <br />with that patch in place, and it seems that suspend/resume is the real <br />issue. Martin Lorenz reports on the same bugzilla entry, and he only has <br />problems with suspend/resume.<br /><br />I assume that "compile the kernel" just triggers some magic ACPI event <br />(probably fan-related due to heat), and I wonder if the bisection faked <br />you out because once you get "close enough" the differences are small <br />enough that the kernel compile is quick and the heat event doesn't <br />actually trigger?<br /><br />See what I'm saying? Maybe the act of bisecting itself changed the <br />results, and then when you just revert the patch, you end up in the same <br />situation: you only recompile a small part (you only recompile that <br />particular file), and the problem doesn't occur, so you'd think that the <br />revert "fixed" it.<br /><br />If it's heat-related, it should probably trigger by anything that does a <br />lot of CPU (and perhaps disk) accesses, not just kernel builds. It might <br />be good to try to find another test-case for it than a kernel recompile, <br />one that doesn't depend on how much changed in the kernel..<br /><br />		Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
