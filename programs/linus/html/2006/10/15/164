Please Cc me on comments, which are most<br />&gt; welcome, as I am not on LKML, although I do peruse the archives.<br /><br />That's a truly horribly disfigured patch - your whitespace is all screwed <br />up.<br /><br />Anyway, the whole approach is not doable. At all.<br /><br />Why? You're doing user-space accesses from within critical sections with a <br />spinlock, and that's just a big no-no. Think page faults, swapping etc.<br /><br />That's ignoring all the issues with the fact that doing the user accesses <br />during recalc_sigpending is broken for other reasons, namely that we don't <br />even _do_ the signal pending recalculation all the time, just when we <br />"know" things may have changed. So your approach would miss updates to the <br />user-space masks.<br /><br />So the whole approach is flawed.<br /><br />You _could_ try to make it do something special at signal delivery time, <br />to see if delivery can be delayed at that point, but quite frankly, it's <br />going to be nasty there too (and that's going to be a disaster for the <br />whole issue of non-thread-specific signals, which have been steered to one <br />thread, and then the new mask would say that they can't be accepted by <br />that thread after all).<br /><br />Quite frankly, you'd probably be better off trying to do totally different <br />approaches. For example, it would be possible to block all signals <br />entirely, and then just create a new system call that uses a _synchronous_ <br />delivery method to avoid races with async delivery. Preferably a file <br />descriptor, so that you can select/poll on it.<br /><br />That was discussed at some point. See for example:<br /><br />	<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/linux.kernel/browse_thread/thread/1332715ae3e26b9/1f3fc521db812a07?lnk=st&amp;q=&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#1f3fc521db812a07">http://groups.google.com/group/linux.kernel/browse_thread/thread/1332715ae3e26b9/1f3fc521db812a07?lnk=st&amp;q=&amp;rnum=1&amp;hl=en#1f3fc521db812a07</a><br /><br />which I found by just googling for "synchronous signal queue" with me as <br />the author. That's from almost four years ago, and nobody ever got quite <br />excited enough about it to actually take it any further, but I still think <br />it's a lot better than the alternatives like yours..<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
