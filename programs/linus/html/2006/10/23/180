Did you test 2.6.19-rc2-git6, <br />&gt; &gt; and that was fine? Or did you just happen to test -git7, and the previous <br />&gt; &gt; kernel you did this on was some much older one?<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I'm seeing the same thing here between rc2-git6 and rc2-mm2 on intel<br />&gt; 945-based hardware and similar.   (rc2-git6 WORKS, rc2-mm2 FAILS)<br />&gt; rc2-git6: for the most part works fine.<br />&gt; rc2-mm2: Restart works - shutdown freezes.<br /><br />Ok, it would be nice if you can verify that -git7 breaks for you too, but <br />considering the identical symptoms, I think we can take it for granted <br />that the breakage happened between 2.6.19-rc2-git6 and -git7.<br /><br />In git terms, according to the snapshot ID translations, that would be:<br /><br />	-git6: 7b7fc708b568a258595e1fa911b930a75ac07b48<br />	-git7: 5cfc35cf79d46af998346e3d5cc66fa344d1af0e<br /><br />and indeed, looking at "gitk 7b7fc708..5cfc35cf", that includes both the <br />x86 and IDE merges.<br /><br />I would expect that it's the IDE code updates (based on the fact that it <br />_apparetly_ freezes at or just after flushing the second IDE device), but <br />it could certainly be some of the x86 architecture changes too.<br /><br />Now, if somebody who sees this has git installed, or just wants to try it <br />out and never had the reason to do so before, you can help narrow it down <br />with "git bisect" if you want to. I'm betting just one or two reboots <br />would narrow it down to IDE or arch changes, and since there are just 75 <br />commits total in that range, six or seven reboots will show exactly which <br />commit it is.<br /><br />So to bisect, do<br /><br />	git bisect start<br />	git bisect good 7b7fc708b568a258595e1fa911b930a75ac07b48<br />	git bisect bad 5cfc35cf79d46af998346e3d5cc66fa344d1af0e<br /><br />and off you go, marking things "good" or "bad" depending on whether the <br />thing had problems at shutdown (at all points, "git bisect visualize" will <br />show you what is left to be considered..).<br /><br />Sadly, because the problem happens at shutdown, you'd need to reboot twice <br />for each kernel: first to boot into it, then shutdown to test, and then <br />mark it good/bad based on that.<br /><br />But maybe Jeff or Andi can make a guess for a single patch already to try <br />to revert..<br /><br />Jeff, Andi: the symptom as reported by xboom &lt;art&#64;usfltd.com&gt; is that the <br />system locks up at shutdown after this:<br /><br />	...<br />	Unmounting pipe file systems:<br />	Unmounting file systems:<br />	Halting system...<br />	md: stopping all md devices.<br />	Shutdown: hdb<br />	Shutdown: hda<br /><br />Any ideas?<br /><br />Final note: it doesn't _have_ to be x86/IDE changes. There are other <br />things there that just sound less likely: the wireless networking merge, <br />and a small patch-series through Andrew. So if somebody doesn't <br />immediately step up, a few reboots with the "git bisect" thing really <br />would help.<br /><br />			Linus<br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
