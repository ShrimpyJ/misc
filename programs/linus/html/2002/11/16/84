No need to be surprised<br />&gt; that people are asking the questions others have answered before<br />&gt; in a place nobody could see ;)<br /><br />Part of the problem is that the companies involved (mainly Intel and<br />Oracle) both have a hard time just talking about their stuff in public on<br />linux-kernel.  It looks like Intel is getting a lot better at it, it's<br />been my one major message to the people there I know. Oracle engineers<br />still don't seem to talk much publicly about their issues and trials,<br />though.<br /><br />(Part of that may actually be due to stupid benchmark rules. They aren't <br />even allowed to publicize their basic benchmark numbers while doing <br />development, even though those numbers are the primary thing they care <br />about. Frigging stupid rules, entirely designed for closed development.)<br /><br />So not only did you have a feature that is mostly useful only to a <br />smallish group of people - you had that group of people not used to open <br />communication in the first place, AND you had rules that made some of the <br />important part of the communication illegal in the first place.<br /><br />Still wonder why it wasn't widely discussed during development? Intel <br />engineers would bvasically take people asdie in private at conferences <br />talking about what kinds of improvments Oracle was seeing..<br /><br />Oh, well. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
