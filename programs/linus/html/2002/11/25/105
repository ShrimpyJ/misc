I am consolidating existing<br />&gt; practise.<br /><br />It's _still_ crap.<br /><br />The fact is, that a<br /><br />	unsigned int xxxx<br /><br />in a &lt;asm-i386/xxxxx.h&gt; file is fine. On asm-i386, "unsigned int" has <br />well-defined behaviour, and is a well-defined type within that world.<br /><br />However, if you consolidate different files from different architectures,<br />what is acceptable in some random architecture header file is _not_ any<br />more acceptable in a "consolidated" entry. Suddenly, "unsigned int" has no<br />well-defined meaning any more, and certainly not something like "long"  <br />which will sometimes change even on the same architecture depending on<br />compiler options etc.<br /><br />THAT is what I'm complaining about. Code sharing without thinking is BAD. <br /><br />Get rid of made-up types and clean them up to use well-defined types. The<br />whole point of your patch was to clan stuff up, no?<br /><br />In other words: for something like this, don't even bother with strange<br />types like "__kernel_loffset_t32". The type simply does not make sense.<br />The only reason we have __kernel_xxxx types is to export architecture-<br />specific stuff to user space through "types.h", without polluting the<br />POSIX- mandated namespaces.<br /><br />For the 32-bit compatibility stuff, that simply doesn't make sense:<br /><br /> - the types should never be exposed to user space at all on a source <br />   level. It's a ABI compatibility thing, not an API compatibility.<br /><br />   So the "__kernel_xxx" stuff makes no sense, and only shows that <br />   somebody was lazy and did some cut-and-paste followed by adding crud<br />   instead of doing it right (and yeah, that crap was there from before, <br />   but don't sell it as a cleanup)<br /><br /> - the types aren't even architechure-specific any more, since the whole <br />   _point_ of your cleanups is to make the compat32 layer generic. So they <br />   shouldn't be things like "loff_t" at _all_ (never mind the __kernel_ <br />   prefix), they should just be the architecture-independent "u32" or<br />   "s64" or whatever the compat code uses.<br /><br />This is why I think the whole file makes zero sense. Yes, people have <br />copied crap before. But that doesn't make it any better.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
