Reconfiguring the system to use ide-scsi or not is just one more PITA<br />&gt; &gt; thing which needs to be done, or more likely forgotten, with every new<br />&gt; &gt; kernel.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Honestly, I think it's ok to bust the old stuff if needed. This is<br />&gt; simply my opinion from a user standpoint.<br /><br />Anyway, ide-scsi should work as well as it ever did, which is not to say<br />too well.  It's just that the IDE native implementation is cleaner and <br />simpler, and a _hell_ of a lot easier to use.<br /><br />The scsi-generic layer is a total nightmare. If you want to write to the <br />device that is /dev/scd0, you can't just use /dev/scd0, you have to use <br />the right /dev/sgX, and the X depends on how many disks etc you have in <br />the system and where your controller is. The amount of crap you have to do <br />with things like "cdrecord -scanbus" to just figure out what the right <br />device is is just ludicrous.<br /><br />With the native IDE setup, if your CD is /dev/hdc, then that's what you <br />use for cdburning too. Just do "cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc" and that's it. No <br />made-up SCSI bus numbers, no need to try to figure out what the right <br />thing is, no crap. <br /><br />In fact, I hope that in linux-2.7.x the SCSI layer itself will start using<br />the same interface, so that we can drop scsi-generic some day completely.  <br />The interface is totally generic, and doesn't have anything to do with IDE<br />per se - ide-cd.c just needed to be cleaned up enough to be able to use<br />it. The interface really just says "hey, you can push SCSI commands down<br />the request queue" (and ide-cd.c will take the SCSI command and convert it<br />into an ATAPI packet command - which is a pretty trivial transform).<br /><br />So right now, you can do "cdrecord dev=/dev/hdc ..", but because I didn't<br />bother to try to figure out what the SCSI layer wants to do you can _not_<br />do the simple "cdrecord dev=/dev/scd0 .." if you have a SCSI disk. That's<br />nothing fundamental, I just don't think SCSI CD-RW's are very interesting<br />any more, since they are overpriced and hard to find. I hope some SCSI <br />fanatic will do the (probably trivial) addition to sr.c to accept the SCSI <br />ioctl interface.<br /><br />(Hint for such SCSI users: you should just do:<br /><br /> - call "scsi_cmd_ioctl()" in your ioctl routine, and if it returns <br />   ENOTTY that means that it wasn't one of the SCSI generic commands.<br /><br /> - make the request queue handler understand that requests with the<br />   REQ_BLOCK_PC flag set are SCSI packet commands, and "req-&gt;cmd" contains <br />   the command, while "req-&gt;data" and "req-&gt;data_len" are the data for the <br />   command)<br /><br /> - make sure that an open() with the O_NONBLOCK flag set will succeed even <br />   if the medium is not accessible (and will succeed even if it's a<br />   writable open).<br /><br />and that should be pretty much it).<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
