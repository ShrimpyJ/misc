Its a policy, its not the general case policy. The<br />&gt; /proc file is that policy.<br /><br />That's ok, but the current code DOES NOT DO THAT.<br /><br />The current code has no support at all for the notion of policies, and <br />gives absolutely _zero_ support for it. It blindly assumes that the CPU <br />can (and should) run at one frequency, and as long as it does that, I <br />don't want it in the kernel.<br /><br />&gt; cpufreq is cpu speed control not power management policy. I agree<br />&gt; entirely that most people should not be using echo "500" &gt;/proc/... as a<br />&gt; power management policy. <br />&gt; <br />&gt; Likewise /dev/hda is not a file system and peopel should not be using dd<br />&gt; to store there files.<br /><br />You've had that argument before, and it was bogus then - and it is bogus <br />now.<br /><br />It is possible to put a filesystem on top of /dev/hda - because the block<br />layer is designed to allow it. It is not possible to build sane policy<br />upon the current frequency patches, because it is _not_ designed for <br />passing down the policy.<br /><br />Exactly because some chips _need_ to have the policy passed down, the <br />lowest levels need to be able to pass it down.<br /><br />It is _then_ ok to say that "if you do a 'echo 500 &gt; /proc/cpu/freq', that<br />will also imply a policy of a fixed frequency". But if the frequency<br />setting code does not allow for any policy interface AT ALL, then it is<br />fundamentally broken.<br /><br />That's my beef with it. We should not have "generic" interfaces that are<br />known to be fundamentally broken. As it is, the code - as designed - is<br />useless for a growing class of devices.<br /><br />Think of it as a layering issue:<br /> - user level policy<br /> - kernel interface (possibly many - for different policies)<br /> - low-level driver<br /><br />Ok?<br /><br />Now, what the current patches do is (a) one kernel interface (the <br />fixed-frequency one) and (b) low-level drivers.<br /><br />The kernel interface is fine - it doesn't do what I think many people <br />might want to do, but it's simple and I agree that other policies can be <br />implemented with other interfaces. Fine. <br /><br />But the fact that low-level drivers don't even support the notion of a <br />policy means that they are useless for any other interface. And I'm saying <br />that it's a clear design bug, and for no good reason. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
