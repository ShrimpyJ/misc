That seems <br />&gt; to have fallen though (as has the ASP business model), but the patent issue <br />&gt; remains unresolved.<br /><br />At least one problem is exactly the politics played by the FSF, which<br />means that a lot of people (not just me), do not trust such new versions<br />of the GPL. Especially since the last time this happened, it all happened<br />in dark back-rooms, and I got to hear about it not off any of the lists,<br />but because I had an insider snitch on it.<br /><br />I lost all respect I had for the FSF due to its sneakiness.<br /><br />The kernel explicitly states that it is under the _one_ particular version <br />of the "GPL v2" that is included with the kernel. Exactly because I do not <br />want to have politics dragged into the picture by an external party (and <br />I'm anal enough that I made sure that "version 2" cannot be misconstrued <br />to include "version 2.1".<br /><br />Also, a license is a two-way street. I do not think it is morally right to <br />change an _existing_ license for any other reason than the fact that it <br />has some technical legal problem. I intensely dislike the fact that many <br />people seem to want to extend the current GPL as a way to take advantage <br />of people who used the old GPL and agreed with _that_ - but not <br />necessarily the new one.<br /><br />As a result, every time this comes up, I ask for any potential new<br />"patent-GPL" to be a _new_ license, and not try to feed off existing<br />works. Please dopn't make it "GPL". Make it the GPPL for "General Public<br />Patent License" or something. And let people buy into it on its own<br />merits, not on some "the FSF decided unilaterally to make this decision<br />for us".<br /><br />I don't like patents. But I absolutely _hate_ people who play politics <br />with other peoples code.
