Because somebody _will_ be the one that everybody looks at <br />when something breaks.<br /><br />That is probably one of the largest reasons for the "IDE disease". The<br />symptoms of the disease is that people complain about the stuff not<br />working, and the maintainer eventually getting so fed up with the<br />complaints that he stops interacting with reality, and starts worrying<br />about compliance with the documentation instead, hoping that that will fix<br />everything.<br /><br />Which would work fine, except a lot of the time the problems aren't due to <br />things in the documentation, but simply due to hardware that isn't really <br />in spec and needs to have workarounds etc. So once the "this is how it is <br />documented, and if it doesn't work your machine is broken" disease starts, <br />it's all downhill from there.<br /><br />I will claim that this happens for a lot of other hardware too, but in<br />other hardware there often isn't quite as much baggage (people in the end<br />throw out the core and start on a new one without historical cruft), and<br />the inter-driver linkages do not exist to _nearly_ the same degree. When a<br />developer can work with just one chipset, it's still possible to believe<br />that you can keep up. But when you get blamed for all the different IDE<br />problems, you crawl into your shell and go away.<br /><br />This is why I believe that the only sane result in the end is to have<br />independent drivers that probably end up having a lot of duplication (the<br />same way hd.c and ide.c started out with a lot of duplication), but where<br />there truly _can_ be multiple people in charge of their own drivers (and<br />also clear _whose_ problem it is when one IDE controller driver doesn't<br />work).<br /><br />(Some of the infrastructure could be made truly generic, but the generic<br />part should _only_ be for stuff that is truly hardware-independent, and<br />simply _cannot_ be impacted by quirks and outright bugs in the hw<br />implementations. In short, only stuff that can be argued about on a<br />logical and clear level, and where the rules are made up by us, not by<br />quirky hardware).<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
