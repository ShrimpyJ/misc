The rest has _mostly_ been about updating specific drivers to<br />the PCI DMA interface (and various one-liners for the block layer<br />changes).<br /><br />&gt; [By the way, have you asked these people to be maintainer?<br />&gt; Many people are too modest to suggest themselves, but will<br />&gt; accept when asked.]<br /><br />Jens is actually documented as being the SCSI maintainer, but that is<br />probably because he is the block device maintainer and he ended up<br />maintaining the more fundamental changes. I've seen James Bottomley more<br />as the "change SCSI internals" guy, and Doug mentioned that he will have<br />more time to work on 2.5.x not that long ago, so I do think all three<br />consider themselves at least partial maintainers already.<br /><br />I certainly take patches from all three (see above on whether this is<br />optimal for me, though ;)<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.kernel.org<br />More majordomo info at  <a href="http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html">http://vger.kernel.org/majordomo-info.html</a><br />Please read the FAQ at  <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
