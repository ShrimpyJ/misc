That's the one that apparently really wants to<br />&gt;&gt; spread out, possibly due to user-level spinlocks. So I assume it will<br />&gt;&gt; show the reverse pattern, with "kill select_idle_sibling" being the<br />&gt;&gt; worst case. Sad, because it really would be lovely to just remove that<br />&gt;&gt; thing ;)<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Yep, correct. It hurts.<br /><br />I'm *so* not surprised.<br /><br />That said, I think your "kill select_idle_sibling()" one was<br />interesting, but the wrong kind of "get rid of that logic".<br /><br />It always selected target_cpu, but the fact is, that doesn't really<br />sound very sane. The target cpu is either the previous cpu or the<br />current cpu, depending on whether they should be balanced or not. But<br />that still doesn't make any *sense*.<br /><br />In fact, the whole select_idle_sibling() logic makes no sense<br />what-so-ever to me. It seems to be total garbage.<br /><br />For example, it starts with the maximum target scheduling domain, and<br />works its way in over the scheduling groups within that domain. What<br />the f*ck is the logic of that kind of crazy thing? It never makes<br />sense to look at a biggest domain first. If you want to be close to<br />something, you want to look at the *smallest* domain first. But<br />because it looks at things in the wrong order, it then needs to have<br />that inner loop saying "does this group actually cover the cpu I am<br />interested in?"<br /><br />Please tell me I am mis-reading this?<br /><br />But starting from the biggest ("llc" group) is wrong *anyway*, since<br />it means that it starts looking at the L3 level, and then if it finds<br />an acceptable cpu inside that level, it's all done. But that's<br />*crazy*. Once again, it's much better to try to find an idle sibling<br />*closeby* rather than at the L3 level. No? So once again, we should<br />start at the inner level and if we can't find something really close,<br />we work our way out, rather than starting from the outer level and<br />working our way in.<br /><br />If I read the code correctly, we can have both "prev" and "cpu" in the<br />same L2 domain, but because we start looking at the L3 domain, we may<br />end up picking another "affine" CPU that isn't even sharing L2's<br />*before* we pick one that actually *is* sharing L2's with the target<br />CPU. But that code is confusing enough with the scheduler groups inner<br />loop that maybe I am mis-reading it entirely.<br /><br />There are other oddities in select_idle_sibling() too, if I read<br />things correctly.<br /><br />For example, it uses "cpu_idle(target)", but if we're actively trying<br />to move to the current CPU (ie wake_affine() returned true), then<br />target is the current cpu, which is certainly *not* going to be idle<br />for a sync wakeup. So it should actually check whether it's a sync<br />wakeup and the only thing pending is that synchronous waker, no?<br /><br />Maybe I'm missing something really fundamental, but it all really does<br />look very odd to me.<br /><br />Attached is a totally untested and probably very buggy patch, so<br />please consider it a "shouldn't we do something like this instead" RFC<br />rather than anything serious. So this RFC patch is more a "ok, the<br />patch tries to fix the above oddnesses, please tell me where I went<br />wrong" than anything else.<br /><br />Comments?<br /><br />                    Linus<br />[unhandled content-type:application/octet-stream]</pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
