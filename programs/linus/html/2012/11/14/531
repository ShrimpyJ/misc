Again!<br /><br />Btw - and this is tangential/unrelated - I really think that your<br />should strive to *not* base -mm on top of next, but instead put it on<br />top of the release kernel.<br /><br />The "on top of next" approach not only causes you continual problems<br />like the above, it also causes the (related) problem that your email<br />patch-bombs always tend to be fairly late in the merge window, because<br />you need to wait for the big parts of linux-next to have hit my tree.<br /><br />So it's more work for you, and it actually causes merge problems for me too.<br /><br />I realize that you want to test a "everything" kernel, but at the same<br />time, that's actually counter-productive. It means that your tree ends<br />up depending on others, and you have to fight bugs that aren't even<br />necessarily yours at all.<br /><br />And in this particular case, it would be easier for the NUMA people,<br />since your patches would presumably contain Mel's work, so they could<br />more easily rebase on top of your work, rather than the current<br />situation which is ass-backwards and has fundamental odering problems:<br />you want to base your stuff on linux-next, people want to put their<br />numa stuff into linux-next, and you have a bad circle.<br /><br />Of course, people who want to base their work on top of Mel's code<br />often are git users already, so now they'd want a stable git tree<br />(non-rebased) to work on top, so they'd have problems with -mm anyway.<br />I don't know if Mel is a git user at all (there are no commits in the<br />kernel tree that are done by Mel, but maybe Mel has used git<br />elsewhere), but in this case maybe it would be a possibility that<br />Mel's NUMA patches could be done as one single stable -git branch, and<br />come into -mm (and linux-next) that way?<br /><br />So I really think it would be much nicer if you just did your tree<br />directly on top of mine, instead of on top of linux-next. It would<br />make everything easier for everybody.<br /><br />Of course, if you then want to test the combined thing, that's fine,<br />but that merging is also something that git is pretty good at. You<br />could just check the linux-next tree itself, since then Stephen would<br />have done the merging for you.<br /><br />                  Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
