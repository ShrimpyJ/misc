There's no way in<br />hell you can willy-nilly just change them. And if you do change them,<br />and applications break, there is no way in hell you can then blame the<br />application.<br /><br />Yes, I'm upset. Very upset. Why was the error value changed in the<br />first place? There was no reason given, and it was changed to a<br />completely idiotic value. And when applications - understandably -<br />broke, you start asking "why?"<br /><br />If applications didn't care about specific error values, then it<br />wouldn't make sense to have more than one to begin with, and you<br />shouldn't care which one that was. But since applications *do* care,<br />and since we *do* have multiple error values, we stick to the old<br />ones, unless there are some *very* good reasons not to.<br /><br />And those reasons really need to be very good, and spelled out and<br />explained. In this case, none of that was even remotely the case.<br /><br />So your question "why would pulseaudio care" is totally *irrelevant*,<br />senseless, and has nothing to do with anything. Pulseaudio cares, and<br />caring fundamentally makes sense. It's questioning that obvious fact<br />that does not make sense!<br /><br />                   Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
