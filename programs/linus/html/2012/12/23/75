That seems a bug at pulseaudio.<br /><br />Mauro, SHUT THE FUCK UP!<br /><br />It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a<br />maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel<br />maintenance?<br /><br />If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the<br />kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to<br />understand?<br /><br />To make matters worse, commit f0ed2ce840b3 is clearly total and utter<br />CRAP even if it didn't break applications. ENOENT is not a valid error<br />return from an ioctl. Never has been, never will be. ENOENT means "No<br />such file and directory", and is for path operations. ioctl's are done<br />on files that have already been opened, there's no way in hell that<br />ENOENT would ever be valid.<br /><br />&gt; So, on a first glance, this doesn't sound like a regression,<br />&gt; but, instead, it looks tha pulseaudio/tumbleweed has some serious<br />&gt; bugs and/or regressions.<br /><br />Shut up, Mauro. And I don't _ever_ want to hear that kind of obvious<br />garbage and idiocy from a kernel maintainer again. Seriously.<br /><br />I'd wait for Rafael's patch to go through you, but I have another<br />error report in my mailbox of all KDE media applications being broken<br />by v3.8-rc1, and I bet it's the same kernel bug. And you've shown<br />yourself to not be competent in this issue, so I'll apply it directly<br />and immediately myself.<br /><br />WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE!<br /><br />Seriously. How hard is this rule to understand? We particularly don't<br />break user space with TOTAL CRAP. I'm angry, because your whole email<br />was so _horribly_ wrong, and the patch that broke things was so<br />obviously crap. The whole patch is incredibly broken shit. It adds an<br />insane error code (ENOENT), and then because it's so insane, it adds a<br />few places to fix it up ("ret == -ENOENT ? -EINVAL : ret").<br /><br />The fact that you then try to make *excuses* for breaking user space,<br />and blaming some external program that *used* to work, is just<br />shameful. It's not how we work.<br /><br />Fix your f*cking "compliance tool", because it is obviously broken.<br />And fix your approach to kernel programming.<br /><br />               Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
