Was<br />&gt; this the intent?  Seems like dget(result-&gt;d_mounts) is still<br />&gt; appropriate.<br /><br />I decided that there is no point in using d_mounts for the reserved<br />entries, as nothing can be mounted on "." or ".." anyway. <br /><br />In fact, I didn't do the d_mounts thing in real_lookup() either at first: <br />if it isn't in the dcache it cannot be a mount point. That worked fine,<br />_except_ for autofs which puts it into the dcache and turns it into a<br />mount point as part of the lookup.. <br /><br />I considered changing the lookup() code to return the dentry, so that<br />autofs could do the mount point following on its own, and not do the<br />unnecessary pointer traversal for normal names. <br /><br />Yes, I know, it only gets rid of a single unconditional pointer lookup.<br />Call me anal.<br /><br />&gt; The other question is in regards to d_move -- it appears to be possible<br />&gt; for the old dentry to no longer be hashed, as someone could have done a<br />&gt; d_drop on it after the original lookup.  This would confuse your hash<br />&gt; swapping tricks, and it looks like both dentries would get put on the<br />&gt; new parent's hash chain.  Perhaps it's safer to just do the slower<br />&gt; unhash/re-hash?  d_move shouldn't be performance critical anyway.<br /><br />Yeah, but it was so _clean_ with the clever switches..<br /><br />But you're probably right. Damn.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
