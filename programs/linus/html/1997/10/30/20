Sorry to you who see this twice, but I want<br />to get in contact with people who have patches for 2.0.31.. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br />PS. If anybody on the list works for HP in the Silicon Valley area and can<br />lay their hands on a HP DeskJet 560C powersupply to "loan" to me, please<br />contact me. I have the 220V version only, for obvious reasons, and every<br />place I've gone to only sells the whole printer...<br /><br /><br />On Sat, 25 Oct 1997, Linus Torvalds wrote:<br /><br />&gt; <br />&gt; Ok, <br />&gt;  as people have noticed, 2.0.31 isn't the greatest kernel ever: it works<br />&gt; ok most of the time, but a failed try to fix a memory leak actually<br />&gt; results in much (MUCH!) worse problems than the leak itself under certain<br />&gt; circumstances.<br />&gt; <br />&gt;  I'm not personally too interested in the 2.0.x series (everybody together<br />&gt; now:  "No, really?"), but I hope we can make a 2.0.32 with the help of the<br />&gt; LMP group which contains a fix for the 31 mmap ring problem (and probably<br />&gt; also the updated fs/locks.c). I further hope that this will be a question<br />&gt; of days rather than weeks (much less months, like 2.0.31). <br />&gt; <br />&gt;  However, at the same time I actually want to start getting 2.2 ready too. <br />&gt; I've mentioned this a few times before, that I hoped for a code-freeze<br />&gt; before the end of this year so that we could have a 2.2 early next year.<br />&gt; Now, I know this is going to take some people by surprise, but the end of<br />&gt; this year is actually coming pretty close.<br />&gt; <br />&gt;  So people, I would ask for some stability work be done to get a stable<br />&gt; 2.0.32, but as of next week I'd prefer if developers started thinking "Oh,<br />&gt; sh*t, Linus thinks he can freeze us, let's panic".<br />&gt; <br />&gt;  Yes, I'm serious. There are lots of things that people want to get done,<br />&gt; but we have to start freezing some day, and I _have_ warned people (even<br />&gt; if nobody ever seemed to actually notice), so I'm announcing a code-slush,<br />&gt; that will eventually turn into a feature-freeze and then a code-freeze.<br />&gt; <br />&gt;  The code-slush means that there are a few outstanding issues: some<br />&gt; patches accumulated by David (mainly sound, architecture and networking),<br />&gt; and the NFS issues. The kernel NFS server is broken and is outside the<br />&gt; code slush - I assume it will get a major overhaul still. The NFS client<br />&gt; is being debugged.<br />&gt; <br />&gt;  I just made a 2.1.60 which contains some VFS changes to support<br />&gt; pread/pwrite (not too interesting in themselves, althought "Single UNIX" <br />&gt; does want them, but the async IO people might be able to use them to good<br />&gt; advantage with threads). It also contains the Joliet fs etc. That's going<br />&gt; to make some people happy feature-wise. <br />&gt; <br />&gt;  There are still some obvious problems in 2.1 (like ncpfs still doesn't<br />&gt; work because it hasn't been updated to the new VFS interface etc), but I'd<br />&gt; like for people to really start thinking about "Ok, what can I do to make<br />&gt; this _stable_" instead of "Hey, what else do I want?".<br />&gt; <br />&gt;  I'll be away for a few days to be at LISA, but I hope that by the time I<br />&gt; get back I'll have a 2.0.32 to bless, and that the worst panic over an<br />&gt; eventual 2.2 code-freeze will have settled and people are constructive<br />&gt; again.
