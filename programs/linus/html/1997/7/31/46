Don't tell me that glibc now tries to implement the completely<br />broken new POSIX standard for size_t of socket names?<br /><br />I complained to the POSIX people the very same day I found out (Alan<br />sent me a patch that tried to implement it in the kernel, and when I<br />asked him why he did something so stupid and broken he pointed to the<br />POSIX people), but it seems the committee was populated by bungling<br />idiots and they had already passed the thing. <br /><br />It's sad, because POSIX has mostly been on the ball apart from this one<br />major f*ck-up (sorry, there is no polite way of putting it). <br /><br />If any glibc people actually read this list, PLEASE disregard the new<br />and broken POSIX stuff in glibc when it comes to socket name lengths. <br />It is technically broken and it CANNOT work on machines where<br />"sizeof(int) != sizeof(size_t)" (which covers all sane 64-bit<br />implementations). <br /><br />The bottom line is that the socket interface has been passing pointers<br />to integers around for a long time, and the new POSIX standard (whetaver<br />the number is, I forget - 1d?) broke that interface for no good reason. <br /><br />Implementing the broken POSIX standard is horribly stupid: it breaks<br />good, working programs in subtle and very hard-to-find ways. <br /><br />Do NOT implement it, and laugh derisively at anybody who is so clueless<br />that he thinks that particular POSIX standard actually is worth the<br />paper it is printed on.  Only a committee can get it so obviously wrong,<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
