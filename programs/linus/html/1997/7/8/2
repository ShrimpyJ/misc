Sure is a pretty<br />&gt;sight when all the colors flash by ;-)<br /><br />Hey, that's a new one.  I have some features on my machine, but no<br />pretty colours. <br /><br />&gt;The kernel crashes after mounting all disks, briefly flashes a console full<br />&gt;of weirdly colored characters and reboots.  No messages make it to<br />&gt;/var/log/messages, nothing can be seen when it goes down either..<br />&gt;<br />&gt;Besides, I've got this too when building:<br />&gt;<br />&gt;  inode.c: In function `fat_read_super':<br />&gt;  inode.c:332: structure has no member named `s_mounted'<br /><br />Yup, 2.1.44 only supports ext2, /proc, NFS and autofs. You can draw your<br />own conclusions as to which filesystems I tend to use personally ;)<br /><br />&gt;How about stopping this nonsense where "testing" kernels do mostly work<br />&gt;(2.1.44-pre[23]), "beta" ones (2.1.4[34]) just don't?<br /><br />Well, the problem was/is that both 43 and 44 had _lots_ of very new code<br />in them.  Some of the pre-44's (but by no means all of them) had fixes<br />for the worst breakage, but then the later 44's ("for-davem") generally<br />took a radically new approach to the dcache and didn't boot very well at<br />all. <br /><br />The real 2.1.44 boots for me and is usable enough that I'm actually<br />doing all my work on it - it's great performance-wise.  However, I<br />certainly agree that it is featureful. <br /><br />The reason I released it is (a) I wanted people to find all the<br />features, and hoped that some people out there would actually start to<br />work on them and (b) I had half a meg worth of patches (mainly different<br />ports) that I needed to get out before some of the people out there lose<br />track of my source tree..<br /><br />So anybody out there with a hankering for kernel hacking, go right<br />ahead.  It shouldn't blow up quite as spectacularly as it seems to do<br />for you, but I notice that you have quota enabled and seem to be using a<br />few filesystem modules and that might trigger behaviour that I haven't<br />seen. <br /><br />Never fear, we'll get this sorted out in a few patch-levels, but it's<br />going to be a lot easier for me if there are people who get their hands<br />dirty..<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
