The kernel tries to handle this, but the i386 braindamage<br />&gt; &gt; does result in threads being inherently unsafe because there are various<br />&gt; &gt; nasty race conditions that a thread library could hit. <br />&gt; <br />&gt; You just said that only kernel is hit by this. But is not threads<br />&gt; library part of userland? Why does especialy threads library care<br />&gt; about wp bit being broken?<br /><br />It's not the threads _librray_. It's the kernel threads.<br /><br />The issue with kernel threads is that they share the same address space,<br />which means that one thread can change the mapping of another thread in<br />the middle of some operation. <br /><br />In particular, one thread can change the mapping of another thread in<br />between that other thread testing the i386 WP bit by hand and actually<br />writing to the page. It's a small window, and probably _very_ hard to<br />actually take advantage of, but it's there. <br /><br />That race doesn't exist on any sane hardware, because we don't need to<br />test the WP bit by hand (and let me re-iterate that "i386" here does NOT<br />cover the whole line of 32-bit intel CPU's, but really _only_ the _3_86. <br />Any i486+ machine is fine). <br /><br />&gt; &gt; This is fixed in the i486 and up, and the threads race problem only<br />&gt; &gt; shows up for code that tries to be malicious on purpose, so it is mostly<br />&gt; &gt; harmless (hint: if you're using a 386 as a server that accepts logins,<br />&gt; &gt; you should probably try to hit somebody for a 486 - there must be tons<br />&gt; &gt; of them lying around). <br />&gt; <br />&gt; I do not think so. Not here :-(. BTW such warnings should be better<br />&gt; written out somewhere, I always thought that 386s are expected to<br />&gt; work... And btw replacing board  is somehow non-trivial for portable<br />&gt; computers... Bad, bad, bad.<br /><br />I'd be more than happy to say somewhere that "a i386-based machine works<br />fine, but you shouldn't NOT allow logins on them in security-conscious<br />areas". <br /><br />Note that that doesn't mean that a i386 isn't a fine server: you can<br />happily use old i386 machines as web-servers, routers, NFS servers etc. <br />But you should _not_ allow potentially nasty people to actually log on to<br />them and use their own programs.. <br /><br />There are other reasons for not using i386-class machines: most of the<br />386's that I've seen had the so-called "popad bug". The popad bug is<br />deadly in protected mode - in real mode it only trashed the %eax register,<br />but in protected mode will actually lock up the CPU under the right<br />circumstances. <br /><br />I haven't really considered this to be a Linux problem - both of the<br />problems are due to hardware bugs (although the WP bit behaviour is<br />classified by intel as a "feature"). And if you allow interactive logins<br />to your machine, you probably want to have more horsepower than a i386<br />will give you anyway. <br /><br />I also wouldn't consider this a problem on a portable computer: it really<br />is a problem only for computers where you allow foreign logins from people<br />you don't trust. If you give a portable computer to somebody, you<br />implicitly trust them with the hardware (and any software measures are<br />moot at that point with any portably _I_ have seen so far). <br /><br />Note that a cracker cannot misuse the i386 bugs without being able to run<br />his own programs on the machine. He has to be able to run a program he has<br />written (because none of the standard installation programs will even try<br />to do anything nasty).<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
