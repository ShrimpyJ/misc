David Miller.<br /><br /> - Sparc updates. David &amp; co.<br /><br /> - poll() system call. This one was required by Digital UNIX<br />   compatibility, and as just about everybody else (except native<br />   Linux/x86) including iBCS2 had a poll() emulation on top of select() I<br />   decided to do it _correctly_. In 2.1.23 the native internal interface<br />   is actually closer to "poll()", and select() is implemented on top of<br />   that interface.<br /><br />The poll() stuff (along with some other things) make Linux able to run<br />Digital UNIX 4.0 shared libs (or at least "netscape"), so if anybody has<br />had problems with the Digital UNIX binary compatibility on alphas you<br />might want to check it out with this kernel instead. <br /><br />The SMP code isn't efficient _yet_, so don't expect to see a large jump in<br />scalability at this point. It's just a huge conceptual step on the way to<br />real scalability. And _definitely_ worth checking out for stability,<br />because the patches are non-trivial. <br /><br />The sparc update means that the default kernel should be more-or-less in<br />sync with David Miller. Pretty much total integration. <br /><br />Oh, over to other things. I just learnt that there have been lots of<br />patches on the kernel mailing lists, and people have wondered why they<br />haven't been applied. The simple answer is that I haven't been reading the<br />mailing lists for the last month or two, due to the new baby and my<br />thesis. The noise ratio was simply too bad for it to make much sense. <br /><br />Please do continue to use the kernel mailing list for patches - but use it<br />more as a "please test this out before I submit this to Linus" medium. If<br />you have real patches that you _really_ think should go in the standard<br />kernel, you should send them to me directly (or alternatively to the<br />people that maintain that particular subsystem - I am not necessarily<br />always the best person to send patches to). <br /><br />Final note: it is likely that our move to the US starts at the end of next<br />week. That's when the computers are packed and take the boat abroad. As a<br />result, I probably won't have access to computers at home, and while I<br />certainly intend to continue to maintain the kernel (through the<br />university), I'll have even less time for secondary concerns. Bug-reports<br />and valid patches will always be wellcome, but I might not react much to<br />anything else..<br /><br /> Sorry for the inconvencience, I can only say that this should be<br />temporary until we get settled down in the US..<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
