Their<br />patches were developed separately from the "official" Linux patches, but<br />intel people tried to help and were hobbled by some stupid intel rules<br />that would have required me to sign an NDA for the full story before<br />last Friday (which I wasn't willing to do - thus the separate efforts). <br /><br />So the quite is accurate, although it doesn't tell the whole story.<br /><br />Note that the real heroes here are Alan Cox and especially Ingo Molnar,<br />who did the gruntwork. Intel did a fairly good job, but they really<br />should reconsider some of their standard procedures (and I still think<br />they should fire a few lawyers).<br /><br />If the Linux people had been any less competent, intel would have been a<br />great help, but as it was the "native" Linux patches were done before<br />the intel patches.  We should be proud - nobody else was able to do that<br />(the BSDi patches were intel patches released _despite_ a NDA, and later<br />pulled off their site due to that). <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
