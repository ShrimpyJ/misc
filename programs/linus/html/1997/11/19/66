So it<br />&gt;&gt; will not only do the IDT access as a locked cycle, it will do it as a<br />&gt;&gt; locked cycle that requires write permissions.. <br />&gt;<br />&gt;Is it possible to abuse this bug (or something similar) to actually<br />&gt;*WRITE* something into IDT? For now, we have DoS attack on pentium,<br />&gt;writing there would (maybe) give you Ring 0, which means root which<br />&gt;means hacked machine...<br /><br />No.<br /><br />The reason for the lock-up in the first place is really that the IDT<br />access is so messed up - the pentium is doing it as a locked (and now we<br />know it's also doing it as a write-permission) access, but because it<br />then never would write to the IDT to release the lock, the whole machine<br />stops dead due to the bus being incorrectly locked. <br /><br />The above isn't really the full story - there are various cache and<br />TLB-related issues that can hide the lock-up, and that can make it<br />harder to produce under certain circumstances.  But essentially the<br />problem is that the CPU _thinks_ that it's going to do a locked<br />read-modify-write cycle, even thought it really is going to only do a<br />read from the IDT. <br /><br />So as far as I know, this particular bug will not do anything else than<br />lock up the machine, and as has been demonstrated it's actually a very<br />easy bug to work around now that we know about the write protect thing. <br />The original fix worked, but was conceptually quite complex.  The new<br />and improved ("25% more for the SAME price") workaround is so simple<br />that the bug really no longer is a problem at all once you know about<br />it. <br /><br />(Well, at least under Linux.  I suspect it might be much more<br />problematic on some other systems, and I wouldn't want to be the one<br />that tries to do it on a Windows95 setup.  Although I doubt that MS is<br />even going to bother about this on Win95). <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
