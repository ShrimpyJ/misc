The reason<br />for the delay is the new SMP code in 2.1.30 - this is the first kernel<br />that supports (a limited form of) concurrent kernel CPU usage.  Rather<br />than using just one large lock for the whole kernel, 2.1.30 starts to<br />split the locks into smaller sections.  I've been working on getting<br />that working and stable the last ten days... <br /><br />Note that the 2.1.30 kernel doesn't actually have very many locks: the<br />current locks are mainly concerned with interrupt handling and process<br />scheduling, as those two areas are the most fundamental and any future<br />locking changes rely on these being stable.  As such you shouldn't<br />expect any huge difference in behaviour - Linux still isn't likely to<br />scale linearly on anything that spends appeciable amounts of CPU-time in<br />kernel mode. <br /><br />However, the change is quite fundamental, and I'd ask anybody who is<br />running Linux/SMP to try out the new kernel if you're at all willing to<br />test bleeding-edge stuff.  I haven't yet much looked into the impact of<br />the new code on uni-processor machines, but I'd certainly appreciate<br />comments and potential patches for UP-related issues too... <br /><br />Final comment: I've been very much in hack mode for the last week,<br />concentrating on making sure the SMP code is basically sane.  As usual,<br />that means that my email queue hasn't gotten all that much attention,<br />and if you have a patch that didn't find its way into 2.1.30 it is<br />probably best to re-send..  Sorry. <br /><br />The 2.1.30 SMP change fixes the SMP lockup problem (this is the same<br />problem that had an interim fix in 2.1.29).  If you have problems with<br />your SMP setup tending to silently just lock up under heavy load, this<br />kernel is definitely worth testing. <br /><br />Finally - 2.1.30 is likely to break on non-x86 platforms.  I hope to get<br />that fixed soon (our machines from Finland still haven't arrived, so I<br />can't do alpha development right now, but that should be rectified<br />soon). <br /><br />Comments?<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
