Which is what tty-&gt;low_latency = 1 did. That provides your<br />&gt; required causality.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; So what exactly is the problem.<br /><br />The problem is that you seem to be arguing against the _nicer_ fix, that <br />also makes more conceptual sense, and that doesn't even depend on the <br />whole low-latency hackery.<br /><br />And I don't see why you argue that.<br /><br />Furthermore, you have been CONTINUALLY arguing that emacs is buggy. <br />Without any logic to back that up what-so-ever. You argued that just a few <br />minutes ago. <br /><br />Why? Why are you making those outlandish claims? What I'm so unhappy about <br />is that your whole reaction to it - from the beginning - was to blame <br />anything but the patch that caused it, and that it was bisected down to.<br /><br />Why? Why blame emacs? Why call user land buggy, when the bug was <br />introduced by you, and was in the kernel? Why are you fighting it? Why did <br />it take so long to admit that all the regressions were kernel problems? <br />Why were you trying to dismiss the regression report as a user-land bug <br />from the very beginning?<br /><br />Let me quote one of your first emails as I got cc'd on this thread:<br /><br />    &gt; &gt; See the thread starting here: ("possible regression with pty.c commit")<br />    &gt; &gt;    <a href="https://lkml.org/lkml/2009/7/11/125">http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/7/11/125</a><br />    &gt; <br />    &gt; Thanks for the pointer.<br />    &gt; <br />    &gt; Well, I thought we were expected to avoid breaking existing user space, even<br />    &gt; if that were buggy etc.<br /><br />    I don't know where you got that idea from. Avoiding breaking user space<br />    unneccessarily is good but if its buggy you often can't do anything about<br />    it.<br /><br />That was you talking to Rafael, who tracks regressions, and trying to<br />argue that it wasn't a kernel bug (both in the double quoted thing and<br />in the final one).<br /><br />And no, that was not a fluke. TODAY, you sent out an email saying that <br />EWOUDLBLOCK/EAGAIN would be "correct". Despite me having told you that it <br />_clearly_ is not correct, and despite you knowing that it breaks user <br />space.<br /><br />WHY?<br /><br />Quite frankly, I don't understand why I should even have to bring these <br />issues up. You should have tried to fix the problem immediately, without <br />arguing against fixing the kernel. Without blaming user space. Without <br />making idiotic excuses for bad kernel behavior.<br /><br />The fact is, breaking regular user applications is simply not acceptable. <br />Trying to blame kernel breakage on the app being "buggy" is not ok. And <br />arguing for almost a week against fixing it - that's just crazy.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
