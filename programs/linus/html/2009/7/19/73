I've *never*<br />&gt; had any need for any use of this personality feature and this net/tun.c<br />&gt; exploit has proven there can be security gotchas with it.<br /><br />I do agree. Some of those features may not be worth the cost.<br /><br />That said, this particular feature made sense at the time it was <br />implemented. Some people really _did_ care about running SVR4 binaries on <br />Linux. There was a time when it was seen as a feature, and important <br />enough to work with. So that "map a zero page at NULL" was an important <br />thing that we wanted such binaries to be able to depend on.<br /><br />These days? We could probably get rid of that idiotic feature. It's simply <br />not important enough any more. Does anybody really care? At the same time, <br />over years we've grown _other_ personality flags, and some of them are <br />still relevant.<br /><br />Some binaries are unhappy with address space randomizations. Sometimes <br />it's because of outright bugs (that just were hidden by non-randomized VM <br />layout) - but that doesn't really help, does it? If you depend on that <br />binary, as a user you want the ability to say "run this binary in a mode <br />where it works".<br /><br />Other binaries are unhappy with address space randomization because they <br />need to get the absolute maximum contiguous VM space for some big array. <br />Ok, so that's less of an issue in 64-bit mode, but there really are <br />programs out there that link everything statically and want to run at a <br />low virtual address so that they can get 2.5GB of virtual memory for one <br />single big allocation. I've written crap like that myself. I'm not _proud_ <br />of it, but I could easily see that programs like that could be unhappy if <br />the system wiggles mmap's around for security issues.<br /><br />So I do agree that we can probably get rid of some really dated <br />personality bits. But I don't think we can really get rid of the concept. <br />Because compatibility is always of paramount importance.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
