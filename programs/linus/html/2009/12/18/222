I'm past that now. But haven't done a bisect [good|bad] on the<br />&gt; results of that one yet. Did you see Alain's email response to my bisect<br />&gt; progress report to him?<br />&gt; <br />&gt; I'm still at a loss as to how to proceed?<br /><br />Ahh, the HPET issue.<br /><br />That one is actually very interesting information, because we've had <br />problems with HPET before. But what I would suggest is to try to continue <br />to bisect with HPET enabled (to see the problem), and the commit that you <br />couldn't even boot with HPET enabled you should not count as good or bad <br />because you just don't know.<br /><br />You can do "git bisect skip" to make git know that some particular commit <br />is not a commit you can test, and you can also move away from a whole <br />problematic region to another area by doing<br /><br />	git bisect visualize<br /><br />to bring up a graphical gitk view of what all you have left to bisect, <br />pick a good point (still _reasonably_ close to the middle) there, and do<br /><br />	git reset --hard &lt;the-point-you-want-to-test&gt;<br /><br />and try that kernel instead of the one git bisect suggested.<br /><br />But this floppy DMA inconsistency being somehow HPET-related is <br />interestign in itself. One thing that HPET does si to obviously change how <br />we read the time - and what that can cause (totally indirectly) is that <br />now we don't touch the southbridge with IO accesses nearly as much, <br />because instead of going to the old 8253 PIT will touch the same legacy <br />chip support that implements the floppy controller itself.<br /><br />So it's entirely possible that the reason a non-HPET setup doesn't show <br />this is that the accesses to the i8253 PIT part will "synchronize" the old <br />floppy controller too, and hide some issue.<br /><br />But still, I assume you had HPET enabled in 2.6.27, so it would be <br />interesting to see exactly when the problem starts. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
