It's certainly not <br />&gt; production ready, but it would be greatly beneficial to be in mainline for <br />&gt; the same reasons other file systems like btrfs and exofs were merged <br />&gt; early.<br /><br />So what happened to ceph is the same thing that happened to the alacrityvm <br />pull request (Greg Haskins added to cc): I pretty much continually had a <br />_lot_ of pull requests, and all the time the priority for the ceph and <br />alactrityvm pull requests were just low enough on my priority list that I <br />never felt I had the reason to look into the background enough to make an <br />even half-assed decision of whether to pull or not.<br /><br />And no, "just pull" is not my default answer - if I don't have a reason, <br />the default action is "don't pull".<br /><br />I used to say that "my job is to say 'no'", although I've been so good at <br />farming out submaintainers that most of the time my real job is to pull <br />from submaintainers who hopefully know how to say 'no'. But when it comes <br />to whole new driver features, I'm still "no by default - tell me _why_ I <br />should pull".<br /><br />So what is a new subsystem person to do?<br /><br />The best thing to do is to try to have users that are vocal about the <br />feature, and talk about how great it is. Some advocates for it, in other <br />words. Just a few other people saying "hey, I use this, it's great", is <br />actually a big deal to me. For alacrityvm and cephfs, I didn't have that, <br />or they just weren't loud enough for me to hear.<br /><br />So since you mentioned btrfs as an "early merge", I'll mention it too, as <br />a great example of how something got merged early because it had easily <br />gotten past my "people are asking for it" filter, to the point where _I_ <br />was interested in trying it out personally, and asking Chris&amp;co to tell me <br />when it was ready.<br /><br />Ok, so that was somewhat unusual - I'm not suggesting you'd need to try to <br />drum up quite _that_ much hype - but it kind of illustrates the opposite <br />extreme of your issue. Get some PR going, get people talking about it, get <br />people testing it out. Get people outside of your area saying "hey, I use <br />it, and I hate having to merge it every release".<br /><br />Then, when I see a pull request during the merge window, the pull suddenly <br />has a much higher priority, and I go "Ok, I know people are using this".<br /><br />So no astro-turfing, but real grass-roots support really does help (or <br />top-down feedback for that matter - if a _distribution_ says "we're going <br />to merge this in our distro regardless", that also counts as a big hint <br />for me that people actually expect to use it and would like to not go <br />through the pain of merging).<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
