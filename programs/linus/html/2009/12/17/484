Not everything I merged yesterday <br />and today were late pull requests, but a lot of it was. I'm used to have a <br />fairly busy last day of the merge window, but it was a busy last two days <br />this time - definitely worse than usual.<br /><br />The two-week merge window is _not_ supposed to be "one day merge window <br />after thirteen days of silence". In fact, I think that next time around <br />I'll make the merge window be 11-12 days instead, and people who try to <br />game the system and do a last-minute pull request will get a surprise, and <br />get unceremoniously bumped to 2.6.35 instead.<br /><br />Anyway, apart from that grumbling, it's been a fairly normal merge window, <br />I think. According to git dirstat (which got fixed to give more accurate <br />numbers), the distribution of changes is pretty much<br /><br /> - 1/3rd staging<br /> - 1/3rd "rest of drivers"<br /> - 1/3rd "everything else"<br /><br />with about half of that final "everything else" third being arch stuff, <br />and half being random other things (firmware, fs, net).<br /><br />Notable additions? There's a number of drivers, and depending on which <br />ones you use, you'll find them more or less notable. I personally like how <br />I finally got to merge the Nouveau code, for example. Others will care <br />about other things.<br /><br />Please give it a good testing, so that we can start figuring out the <br />inevitably regressions,<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
