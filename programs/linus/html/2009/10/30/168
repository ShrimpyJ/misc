Just making suspend act <br />&gt; as an eject would mean that we'd never have to worry about how the CardBus <br />&gt; bridge interacts with the PCI layer at suspend/resume time.<br /><br />Put another way: five years ago I would have felt that it could be <br />important that people can suspend and resume while they have a CD-ROM <br />mounted through a PCMCIA IDE card. Or something like that where you want <br />to keep session information.<br /><br />These days, that scenario is less interesting to begin with, and we're <br />generally better at some of the hotplug issues anyway. Example: one of the <br />reasons I used to like not causing an unplug event was because I had <br />network cards, and hated setting up the connection again. These days, all <br />distros come with networkmanager or similar, and hotplug networking just <br />works (even if the "CD-ROM mounted" case probably still would cause <br />problems).<br /><br />So I think we used to have good reasons to try to maintain state over a <br />suspend event, but many of those reasons have become weaker, while at the <br />same time USB has meant that PCMCIA itself has become more of a <br />"maintenance burden" rather than a "primary subsystem".<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
