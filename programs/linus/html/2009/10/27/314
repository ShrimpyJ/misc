If <br />you haven't gotten Ack's, you have two choices:<br /><br /> - that commit should not show up in a tree that is marked for -next, <br />   because it's still waiting for feedback and people to test it. It may <br />   be in a _private_ git tree of course, but it's not "ready" yet.<br /><br /> - you are going to commit it regardless of acks or not, and you don't <br />   care, and you shouldn't lie about it later.<br /><br />Those are the two obvious choices. Adding ack's later, after it has <br />already been exported and tested in -next is kind of pointless, isn't it? <br />It's basically lying about how the patch came to be.<br /><br />If you want Ack's from people, then send that patch around by email.<br /><br />NOTE! If you know the people you want acks from are git users, then the <br />email can certainly be something like "look at so-and-so branch of my git <br />tree &lt;here&gt;". You can certainly use private git branches as a way to talk <br />to other developers about code you're not fully happy with yet, with the <br />clear understanding that you want acks and comments on it.<br /><br />Put another way: there's a big conceptual difference between "public git <br />tree" and "private git branch that may well be available to others and <br />is meant for development". In git itself, Junio has the 'pu' branch that <br />is clearly marked as being rebased etc.<br /><br />				Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
