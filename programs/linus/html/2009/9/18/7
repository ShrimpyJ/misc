Some of them are scripted (by <br />fairly trivial scripts), some of them are done by hand, but they tend to <br />all have the same structure: a 'shortlog' of the commits that are new, and <br />a diffstat (with summary) of the changes.<br /><br />The important thing is that then I know what to expect from the pull, <br />rather than having to pull blindly and see the end result (without really <br />knowing whether that was what you intended for me to get).<br /><br />There's even a 'git request-pull' script that comes with git that <br />generates these things, although I'm not sure how many people use that <br />particular script.<br /><br />But just look for "please pull" on lkml, and you'll find a lot of <br />examples.<br /><br />Btw, I appreciate people not sending just the raw unedited "git <br />request-pull" output. I'd like people to actually look at it to make sure <br />that the thing matches what you expected, but also add a few lines of your <br />own to describe the changes in your own words.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
