Because they really _are_ special, and no other<br />&gt; &gt; permissions ever make sense for them.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; That's true. I guess there are a few more devices that need special<br />&gt; permissions.<br /><br />/dev/tty is probably the only remaining one - I don't think there should <br />be any other devices that are so special that normal programs expect them <br />to be there, and expect to be able to open them.<br /><br />/dev/null (and to a lesser degree /dev/zero) really are special, and they <br />are special not so much because they are special devices, but because they <br />are part of the unix environment in rather deep ways. For example, mmap() <br />on /dev/zero is deeply special, and really is about shm rather than any <br />devices, so it's a VM thing with an odd special case.<br /><br />And /dev/tty is special in that you'd expected to be able to open it even <br />if you can't open the device that it points to - you may have inherited a <br />tty from a program that _used_ to have permission to the underlying <br />/dev/ttyxyz thing, but even if you no longer can open that device, <br />/dev/tty still works.<br /><br />The rest of /dev really should be rather esoteric, or it should be about <br />real devices. So I do think that with just null, zero and tty having 0666 <br />permissions, a "normal UNIX" program is supposed to work. That should be <br />the minimal set, but also the maximal set of devices that people should <br />_expect_ to work.<br /><br />(Yeah, there are things like /dev/stderr etc, but they are symlinks to <br />/proc/self/fd anyway, so permissions don't matter)<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
