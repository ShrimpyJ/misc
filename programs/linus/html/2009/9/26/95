I first noticed it on a 2.6.31-git9 kernel with a some<br />&gt; additional ext4 patches.  I've since bisected it to the following merge<br />&gt; commit: a03fdb76.  The commit does have some merge conflict fix ups, but<br />&gt; only for the some files in the m68knommu and mips architectures.<br /><br />Yeah, no conflicts on the x86 side. But there can obviously be <br />interactions between the timer changes and the other changes, although <br />looking at it that does look rather unlikely.<br /><br />One thing that _can_ be done for these kinds of merge conflicts is to just <br />turn the merge into rebase, and then bisecting that rebase. So in this <br />case, you could do something like this:<br /><br />	# Check out the timer side of the merge<br />	git checkout -b timer-branch a03fdb76^2<br /><br />	# instead of merging it into the mainline, rebase it on top of it<br />	git rebase a03fdb76^<br /><br />	# resolve the trivial problem in arch/mips/lemote/lm2e/setup.c<br />	# the same way the merge did (do the 'git add' just to make <br />	# checkout happy<br />	git rm arch/mips/lemote/lm2e/setup.c<br />	git rebase --continue<br /><br />and now you have the exact same tree as the merge resulted in (apart from <br />the 'arch/mips/loongson/common/time.c' that was broken in the merge <br />anyway, but that also doesn't matter), and now you can bisect the series <br />and see exactly _which_ commit it is that has problems.<br /><br />So now you can just bisect it by doing<br /><br />	git bisect start<br />	git bisect bad timer-branch<br />	git bisect good a03fdb76<br /><br />and off you go.<br /><br />The above is a generic way to handle bisection problems with merges, <br />although admittedly it only really works in practice for the simple cases <br />(if there is lots and lots of independent development on both sides, it's <br />not going to be a reasonable thing to do).<br /><br />That said, I do wonder if you're hitting some timing-dependent thing. The <br />whole "second suspend fails" is not an uncommon problem case. Others have <br />had it, and it's possible that it's not going to be the actual merge that <br />is the problem, but that just some odd combination of code ends up hitting <br />the case that causes it for you. But the bisect above should still be <br />interesting, since it will point to _some_ commit that triggers it, and <br />then we can say whether that commit makes sense or not..<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
