Quite the reverse. I'm <br />saying that most rwlocks are totally _unimportant_. Being a rwlock does <br />_not_ make anything more important or less important in itself, so your <br />argument is bogus. You have to base importantness on other issues than <br />whether they are rwlocks or not.<br /><br />As far as I can tell there is _one_ single important rwlock, and that's <br />tasklist_lock. Everything else could probably trivially and individually <br />be turned into a spinlock if fairness matters for them. But tasklist_lock <br />fundamentally depends on the semantics of rwlocks.<br /><br />And that one rwlock requires unfair behavior, and is not going to be happy <br />with some more complicated thing (because it is also called from some <br />pretty critical pathways).<br /><br />So my argument is purely:<br /><br /> - there is absolutely NOBODY who cares about "fair" rwlocks, because no <br />   other user will ever hit its lock enough for it to matter. And if they<br />   really do, most of them tend to be fairly simple and localized and <br />   might be turned into spinlocks.<br /><br /> - the _one_ major exception to this - somebody who does hit the lock <br />   enough for fairness to matter - is not likely amenable to any kind of <br />   trivial fairness.<br /><br />Now, I'd love to come up with some solution to tasklist_lock, but I just <br />don't see it. At least nothing easy that doesn't have tons of downsides <br />(like turning it into a spinlock, using the irq-safe versions, and having <br />irq's potentially disabled for much longer than I think is good).<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
