For example, if we went to this, the giant monitor<br />&gt; &gt; attached to my laptop that I actually look at would go unused.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; yeah, normally VBIOS startup just needs or only can driver one pipe, so<br />&gt; we don't have any pre knowledge except detect everything.<br /><br />Umm. What's your guys point, exactly?<br /><br />The fact is, as-is, YOU DETECT THE WRONG OUTPUTS!<br /><br />If you actually detected things _right_, none of this would be an issue. <br />But you don't. And you seem to have a really hard time even admitting <br />that. You try to re-detect things, and you SCREW UP.<br /><br />&gt; we already have some mac relate bugs open, but please report on it so we<br />&gt; do have people with hardware to try and response. We have recently got a<br />&gt; MacBook, yakui is looking after the modesetting issue on it.<br /><br />Quite frankly, I've reported these things several times. I've been open to <br />try patches. Nothing has ever come out of it. <br /><br />I have a Mac Mini that I reported as broken over a month ago. I have a <br />Westemere I've reported as not doing any DDC probing - and that I have to <br />disable the LVDS probing on entirely in order to not make KMS set up the <br />display to go to a non-existent LVDS port.<br /><br />You claim that you "detect everything", but quite frankly, you don't. The <br />KMS code seems to assume that if it's a mobile chipset, it should have an <br />LVDS output - and whether anything is connected to that or not is totally <br />immaterial. There's clearly _zero_ "detection" going on.<br /><br />And the thing is, X seems to get it right, at least more often than KMS <br />does. <br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
