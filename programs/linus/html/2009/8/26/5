You depend on the even _less_ reliable existence of a VBT <br />table.<br /><br />&gt; And our driver does more flexible config than VBIOS does.<br /><br />If by "flexible" you mean "doesn't work in many more ways", then yes.<br /><br />I have never EVER found a BIOS that didn't output to at least _some_ <br />screen that is connected. That's fairly damn fundamental. Yet that is <br />exactly what KMS screws up on some hardware right now.<br /><br />Trust me, "flexible" is not the right word. <br /><br />&gt; We know we have problem on Mac mini, this issue has been known for a while.<br />&gt; And Keith also posted patch at<br />&gt; 	<a href="https://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2009-June/002843.html">http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2009-June/002843.html</a><br />&gt; but I don't know the status of this now.<br /><br />And how about MacBook 2.1, which apparently also goes black?<br /><br />And the Westmere thing? <br /><br />&gt; We've tried many ways to detect LVDS, but none is stable or actually work for<br />&gt; every chip. But now we have DMI quirks for some known no LVDS machine (including<br />&gt; Mac mini), and we detect through ACPI LID object for LVDS exist. <br /><br />And dammit, if you cannot detect it, then don't try.<br /><br />You'd actually be better off not trying your random crud, and instead<br /> - leave whatever connection the BIOS set up<br /> - let the user _tell_ you about other ones.<br /><br />If you cannot reliably detect something, don't go off and use some random <br />number generator. And quite frankly, depending on BIOS tables _is_ a <br />random number generator. It may be that you just haven't learnt that yet, <br />but maybe you could work on ACPI for a while to see what I mean.<br /><br />Right now, there's not even any way to _override_ your incorrect guesses. <br /><br />So I can say "don't do mode-setting at all", but I can't say "use SVDO at <br />1680x1050". So my screen goes black. And I happen to be in the enviable <br />position of having known about the Mac Mini issues and the KMS thing - <br />think about what happens to people that just try a new distro kernel, and <br />suddenly there's nothing on the screen. <br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
