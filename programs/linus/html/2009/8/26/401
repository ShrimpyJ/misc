Here's the thing, we do detect something has changed, we detect we no<br />&gt; longer have a monitor connected on the mac mini because the routing<br />&gt; for the DDC pins is insane and need special treatment in the driver.<br /><br />That's the second thing - DDC in general seems to be _very_ flaky on intel <br />chips.<br /><br />And I don't mean that in a "Mac Mini" kind of sense. I'm seeing in on <br />other machines. Here's my old EeePC 701:<br /><br />	[drm] Initialized drm 1.1.0 20060810<br />	i915 0000:00:02.0: PCI INT A -&gt; GSI 16 (level, low) -&gt; IRQ 16<br />	i915 0000:00:02.0: setting latency timer to 64<br />	i2c-adapter i2c-1: unable to read EDID block.<br />	i915 0000:00:02.0: LVDS-1: no EDID data<br />	[drm] DAC-6: set mode 640x480 0<br />	i2c-adapter i2c-1: unable to read EDID block.<br />	i915 0000:00:02.0: LVDS-1: no EDID data<br />	[drm] TV-11: set mode NTSC 480i 0<br />	allocated 800x480 fb: 0x007df000, bo f735b540<br />	[drm] LVDS-8: set mode 800x480 15<br />	Console: switching to colour frame buffer device 100x30<br /><br />and quite frankly, I suspect you've never ever actually googled for "no <br />EDID data", because if you had, you'd have seen that this is quite common.<br /><br />And yes, the response of KMS seems to be "ok, I failed at EDID, so I'll <br />just assume something isn't there". And then usually it picks LVDS <br />instead, if it finds a VBT table for it. Which happens to work fine on <br />most laptops, but it's still just a random heuristic.<br /><br />And yes, for all I know it's because the display really doesn't do any <br />EDID.<br /><br />And that really kind of is the point - it doesn't even matter whether the <br />problem is the Intel driver doing something wrong on the EDID front (which <br />it has done quite often - ranging from just looking at the wrong port, to <br />not setting the right bits to make bit-banging i2c work AT ALL), or <br />whether the problem is that the hardware is wired up oddly (Mac Mini) or <br />whether it's the hardware simply not doign EDID at all (maybe my EeePC? Or <br />a really old VGA monitor, or whatever).<br /><br />In all three cases the end result is "no EDID", but regardless of that, <br />the correct action is basically _never_ to say "ok, I'll just assume that <br />the display is on connector XYZ regardless of what the state of the <br />graphics chip is".<br /><br />&gt; so yes I think do better at failing is what is needed, its still<br />&gt; failing but its more user friendly fail.<br /><br />Yes. If something fails ("oops, I can't seem EDID for any connector"), I <br />wish KMS would fail way better than just default to some crazy setup. The <br />failure mode should be to at least drive whatever the BIOS enabled.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
