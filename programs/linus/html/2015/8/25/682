So there are probably valid<br />cases in theory for loading firmware at probe time, but pretty much<br />every single case I've ever actually seen, the probe knows what the<br />actual hardware is from some identifiable piece, and the actual<br />firmware loading should be delayed until the piece of hardware is<br />actually opened.<br /><br />So the "load firmware in probe routine" happens, and we shouldn't<br />disallow it, but it should be considered a "last resort" kind of<br />thing.<br /><br />In general, things like sound drivers should *not* need to have their<br />firmware in the initrd, even if you build them into the kernel. A disk<br />driver? Yes. Maybe the root filesystem is on that disk, and you need<br />the firmware for the disk driver to load it. But a sound device?<br />Please just make sure that you load the firmware as late as possible.<br /><br />                        Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
