Comprende? Fair is<br />&gt;&gt; fair.<br />&gt;<br />&gt; Would you accept an updated PULL request with Alexander's patch, or<br />&gt; prefer this whole series wait until v4.5..?<br /><br />You can't just apply Alexander's patch, because that patch wouldn't<br />compile in your tree - it comes about as a conflict due to me having<br />gotten commit 7bd1d4093c2f ("stm class: Introduce an abstraction for<br />System Trace Module devices") from one of Greg's pulls.<br /><br />But what I want maintainers to do is to *tell* be about these things.<br />I have absolutely no issues with handling merge conflicts - they<br />happen all the time.<br /><br />But when those merge conflicts were known about from linux-next, and<br />particularly when those merge conflicts were silent semantic conflicts<br />that didn't even show up as an actual explicit conflict int he git<br />history (only as a compile issue - or worse - a runtime problem), then<br />I want maintainers to<br /><br /> (a) show they were aware of it (you should have been, or there is<br />something wrong in our process)<br />and<br /> (b) let me know about it and point to the resolution.<br /><br />That way I'm not taken by surprise, and things won't fall through the cracks.<br /><br />Yes, I do allmodconfig builds between every pull, which is how I<br />noticed this, but that doesn't always catch things either, and it<br />doesn't catch _other_ configs that may be relevant too.<br /><br />Note that it also doesn't mean that I want you to do the merge for me.<br />I want to be aware of these issues, and I want to see the resolution,<br />and I'm more than happy to do it myself. In fact, I almost insist,<br />unless the resolution is _so_ painful that I push it back to the<br />maintainer. I just want the heads-up about the issue and about the fix<br />for the issue, because that is the upside of linux-next: these things<br />gets noticed there first, exactly so that people can be aware of them.<br /><br />And yes, I also react a lot more negatively when things like this<br />happen with the very end of the merge window in sight. I usually make<br />the actual rc1 release on Sunday, but I want Sunday itself to be<br />pretty much quiet apart from perhaps a "oops, sorry, here's a fix that<br />we just noticed" kind of issues.  I don't want to be taken by surprise<br />like this just a couple of days before I want to do the rc.<br /><br />So please try to just re-send the pull, but this time with<br />explanations of the conflict and a pointer to the fixup for the<br />conflict (some people end up doing a pre-merge for me as an example,<br />in _addition_ to the unmerged tree they send me).<br /><br />I may or may not then use the particular conflict resolution that I'm<br />pointed at or told about (because maybe I decide to do it my way), but<br />regardless it really helps to have a heads-up. And when people go to<br />the effort and do a "and here's a pre-merged version", I basically<br />*always* then end up doing something like<br /><br />     git checkout -b test-merge ORIG_HEAD<br />     git pull &lt;premerged branch&gt;<br />     git diff master<br />    .. everything looks good ..<br />     git checkout master<br />     git branch -D test-merge<br /><br />just to check that yes, we agreed (or, even more interestingly, how<br />our different merges differed).<br /><br />Now, *most* of the time there are no conflicts at all. And then<br />occasionally there are trivial conflicts that just come about because<br />people touched the MAINTAINERS file close to each other. Don't worry<br />about those truly trivial ones, they certainly don't need any kind of<br />"here's how to resolve them" or a pre-merged tree. You could *mention*<br />them ("You'll get a trivial conflict with an obvious resolution in<br />file XYZ"), but quite frankly, even that isn't required.<br /><br />So I'm not asking for some silly extra busy-work. But when linux-next<br />notified you about a conflict, and it wasn't just something trivial,<br />then *that* is when I just want to be told.<br /><br />And yes, part of that "I want to be told" is literally just because I<br />want to see that the whole "process" worked, and that things had been<br />in linux-next, and people had reacted to them. Usually actually<br />resolving the conflict isn't all that hard, and I can always find the<br />linux-next discussions (like I did now).
