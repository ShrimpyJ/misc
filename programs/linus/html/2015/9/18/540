It was never the intent of the<br />&gt; unplug-on-schedule to NOT unplug for certain schedule out events, that seems<br />&gt; like very odd behavior.<br /><br />Actually, even a *full* schedule doesn't unplug, unless the process is<br />going to sleep. See sched_submit_work(), which  will only call the<br />unplugging if the process is actually going to sleep (ok, so it's a<br />bit subtle if you don't know the state rules, but it's the<br />"!tsk-&gt;state" check there)<br /><br />So preemption and cond_resched() isn't _that_ odd. We've basically<br />treated a non-sleeping schedule as a no-op for the task work.<br /><br />The thinking was probably that it might be better to delay starting<br />the IO in case we get scheduled back quickly, and we're obviously not<br />actually _sleeping_, so it's likely not too bad.<br /><br />Now, that's probably bogus, and I think that we should perhaps just<br />make the rule be that "if we actually switch to another task, we run<br />blk_schedule_flush_plug()".<br /><br />But it should be noted that that really *does* introduce a lot of new<br />potential races. Traditionally, our block layer plugging has been<br />entirely thread-synchronous, and would never happen asynchronously.<br />But with preemption, that "switch to another thread" really *does*<br />happen asynchronously.<br /><br />So making things always happen on task switch is actually fairly<br />dangerous, and potentially adds the need for much more synchronization<br />for the IO submission.<br /><br />What we possibly *could* make the scheduler rule be:<br /><br /> - if it's not an actual PREEMPT_ACTIVE (ie in a random place)<br /><br /> - _and_ we actually switch to another thread<br /><br /> - _then_ do the whole blk_schedule_flush_plug(tsk) thing.<br /><br />adding some scheduler people to the explicit cc list.<br /><br />That said, the "cond_resched[_lock]()" functions currently always set<br />PREEMPT_ACTIVE (indirectly - they use preempt_schedule_common()), so<br />even though those are synchronous, right now they *look* asynchronous<br />to the scheduler, so we'd still have to sort that out.<br /><br />Ingo/Peter/Frederic?
