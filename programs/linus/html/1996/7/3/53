A _lot_ larger. Oh, well..<br /><br />Note that despite of the size of this patch, 2.0.0 seems to have been a <br />reasonably stable release, certainly no worse than expected. Keep the <br />reports coming in, and please tell of any problems with the new kernel.<br /><br />Developers: I will NOT accept large patches any more. If you find bugs, <br />go for the one-liner obvious bugfix rather than a rewrite. Due to me <br />being abroad I couldn't work as closely with people on 2.0.1 patches as I <br />need to, but I'm back, and this kind of mega-patch will NOT happen again..<br /><br />The patches do:<br /> - ISDN subsystem updates.<br /> - Sound driver patches. These are actually the largest part of the patches,<br />   happily a lot of it is just comment changes and code re-organization. <br /> - alpha patches: IRQ handling fixes and a updated QLogic ISP driver. <br />   This kernel is stable on the AlphaStation 600. Also some signal <br />   handler patches for POSIX.1 conformance.<br /> - POSIX.1 conformance patches. This is part of my integration of the POSIX.1<br />   certification patches from Unifix. Thanks to the Unifix people for<br />   supplying patches, and especially to Heiko for some additional conformance<br />   comments. <br />   The POSIX patches are mainly details for signal handling and some <br />   error returns. For example, the SIGCHLD semantics that have been <br />   discussed on the kernel list have changed subtly (and "wait()" doesn't <br />   mask out SIGCHLD signals any more, for example).<br /> - loop and md driver updates<br /> - baycom and de4x5 drivers updated<br /> - SCSI tape update + various minor SCSI changes<br /> - NFS client retry fixes<br /> - load average counting should not result in the bogus loads of 1.0 on <br />   idle machines..<br /> - you shouldn't be able to crash the machine with the client/server <br />   program on this list..<br /> - multicast one-liner<br /> - masquerading fixes<br /><br />NOTE! The POSIX.1 patches in 2.0.1 is _not_ the complete set of patches, <br />and I still have some stuff to integrate yet. As such we can't say that <br />2.0.1 is POSIX.1 conformant yet, but the patches really aren't very large <br />(the original POSIX patches were less then 2000 lines, and around half of <br />them are integrated in one form or another).<br /><br />Also note that the POSIX requirements for "rename()" meant that I had to<br />change the VFS interface to the low-level devices. That's rather unfortunate,<br />as it means that binary kernel modules will mostly _not_ work across the<br />2.0.0-&gt;2.0.1 upgrade. However, the new interface should be stable now, and<br />I'd rather have break it now rather than have problems with POSIX.1.. <br /><br />Anything else?<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
