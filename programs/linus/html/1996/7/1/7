I wouldn't dare put my name in the bootmessages,<br />&gt; even if my contribution was more significant.  I just did a<br />&gt; case-insensitive grep for the names of "famous" Linux developers<br />&gt; in my boot messages.  Linus Torvalds was not there - he must not<br />&gt; be very important I guess.  I also checked:<br /><br />[ list of others not mentioned in boot messages deleted ]<br /><br />Yup. I prefer people NOT to put their copyright messages in the boot <br />messages (or in any other interactive format) - it gets really ugly very <br />quickly.<br /><br />Exactly because we do have sources available, you don't NEED to beat your <br />breast in that way: it's only irritating to others, and people who do <br />want to know can look it up (or if you want to show off to somebody, you <br />can just point them to the sources).<br /><br />I _also_ dislike unnecessary copyright messages in source files: it should be<br />quite enough to just state your name, email address (not for legal reasons,<br />but for easy lookup of contact info), year(s) and the "Copyright" notice.<br />There is a COPYING file in the top-level directory, and that's quite enough -<br />if people want to they can add a pointer to the file ("This software is<br />released under the GPL, see the COPYING file for details"), but there is<br />really no need to clutter up the code with anything more. <br /><br />Note: you don't really need anything more for legal reason - any country<br />honouring the Berne copyright conventions should in fact give you the<br />copyright without any copyright statement AT ALL (but for practical reasons<br />you're better off with the one-liner statement anyway). Not having any<br />copyright text does NOT mean that people have any rights to the code anyway.. <br /><br />(In the US you can seemingly register your copyright for some silly legal<br />reason: it makes a difference when assessing damages in cases of copyright<br />infringement. Just one more issue that shows the total disregard for sanity<br />of the US legal system. Damn third world countries. And they have the gall to<br />accuse China of having copyright problems). <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
