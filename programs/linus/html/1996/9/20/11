A subsequent "pwd" complains about the working directory...<br /><br />"Don't do that then".<br /><br />Actually, it's neither a bug nor a POSIX feature: it's just how things <br />work. Directories are just normal files, and you can think of having a <br />directory as your current working directory as having a file open. <br /><br />What happens when you remove a file that you had open? The open file still<br />works, but you can't get at it though the filesystem name-space any more.<br />Similarly, when you remove a directory that you have as you cwd, the<br />directory still exists, but you can't get at it through the filesystem<br />name-space. <br /><br />There is a special restriction here, and that's the fact that a removed<br />directory cannot have new files created in it. That's simply because the<br />kernel doesn't really like the idea of having a file with a non-existent<br />directory as the parent.. <br /><br />Anyway, I think most other UNIX'es will act the same way.<br /><br />[ sounds of logging onto other systems.. ]<br /><br />Solaris, HP-UX and Digital UNIX work the same way as Linux, but Solaris and<br />HP-UX try to be "clever" and notice that you're trying to remove the cwd. But<br />under both the "clever" OS's you can just open another window and removing<br />the cwd in _another_ process, no problem (so the check seems to be just some<br />silly one-liner check added by some Sun/HP/xxx engineer who though the check<br />would be a good idea for some strange reason, but it has no real meaning). <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
