Your point about limiting nesting level to <br />&gt; about 3 is generally valid, but there are _lots_ of places in the Linux <br />&gt; kernel where the nexting level is higher than that (bdflush is one of these).<br />&gt;   So I'd request using just plain "-kr" rather than "-kr -i8".<br /><br />IF I re-indent, it's definitely going to be with "-i8". If that shows up<br />problems in the sources, they need to be fixed, rather than worked around<br />with bad indenting.. (fixing them is boring, I know, but splitting things up<br />into inline functions, or even out-line functions, is a good thing, and bad<br />coding should not be the excuse to not use -i8). <br /><br />However, I don't think I'll re-indent, at least not drivers etc sources that<br />I expect others to work on. I could re-indent the linux/*/*.c files (and the<br />x86 and alpha subdirectories), because those are generally "basic"  files<br />that I expect that I have to support personally, but I don't know if even<br />that is really warranted. I'll think about it. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
