This latest panic is<br />due to "tsk-&gt;sig" being a bogus value (0x43434700 - looks like the string<br />"\0GCC" but that's rather strange too).  That's why it panics when it tries<br />to "cat /proc/x/stat" - the process info is corrupted. <br /><br />Your other panics have looked like the bitmap for the free list handling is<br />corrupted, or possibly just the free list pointers within mem_map[] are<br />totally bad for some reason. It looks like _really_ major memory corruption,<br />but I can't see anything in your setup that could cause it. I can't even<br />blame it on any strange support, as your very minimal kernel also acted very<br />strangely. <br /><br />Quite frankly, it _feels_ like some serious problem with the hardware, but<br />you say that the machine is generally stable. A hardware problem that<br />exhibits this kind of major corruption would be likely to bring the machine<br />down rather quickly, rather than wait for you to run crashme ;-)<br /><br />I could imagine a missing TLB invalidate resulting in problems like these,<br />with user-level programs subtly modifying pages that we have already free'd<br />for other use. I've had those kinds of problems before, but I'd expect those<br />kinds of problems to hit a lot more people (and they shouldn't be repeatable<br />at all). <br /><br />What kernels have worked on this machine? Is 1.2.13 rock solid on it?<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
