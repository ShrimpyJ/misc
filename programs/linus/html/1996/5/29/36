It's not the system, as it behaves properly <br />&gt; under pre2.0.7, so does anyone know of any changes that could cause it? <br /><br />Can you send in the hardware configuration for the machine, and <br />preferably some info on what you use it for? Any patterns at all?<br /><br />The only changes in pre2.0.8 are:<br /> - some sparc-specific stuff in the floppy driver removed (turned out the <br />   stuff wasn't needed)<br /> - IDE driver probes for "Triton II" hardware too.. Maybe there is a <br />   problem with the "Triton II", if you have IDE drives, please just <br />   remove the last ide_probe_pci() line that was added to 2.0.8 (seach for<br />   ide.c in the pre2.0.8 patch to see this). <br /> - de4x5 driver adds a sanity check (looks like it couldn't possibly make <br />   a difference, do you have that driver?)<br /> - tunnel driver does open/close even when not compiled as a module<br /> - seagate SCSI driver warning removed<br /> - truncate() system call correctly iput's the inode if a file lock <br />   results in error conditions..<br /> - i_size was changed back to off_t (original behaviour)<br /> - IP firewall ACK firewalling change<br /> - route.c minor added check..<br /><br />Can you check out the "ide.c" and "route.c" changes (both are _very_ <br />small), and maybe reverse those two and tell me whether the behaviour <br />goes back to normal? I really can't see what could possibly make a <br />difference in pre2.0.8 otherwise (the patch is large, but 99.5% of it is <br />PPC stuff, and I assume you don't have a PPC).<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
