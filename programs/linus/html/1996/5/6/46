Have you been <br />confused by the ethernet card setup? Has it bothered you that the cards <br />weren't sorted alphabetically? Bother no more, just get the new kernel, <br />satisfaction guaranteed!<br /><br />And as if that wasn't enough, the new kernel also adds enhanced security <br />features, while still allowing you to use your old and trusted strace <br />binary without modifications. Isn't that swell?<br /><br />For those of you with floppy drives, look at the new code that adds a few <br />lines to make it even better, especially on sparc machines. And the <br />ide-cd code is leaner and meaner and doesn't do those unnecessary <br />verify_area calls any more. What more do you want?<br /><br />Because if it's more you want, it's more you get. Thanks to our new <br />revolutionary "ReadTheSpecsBeforeYouWrite" Technology (pat- pend.), the <br />IDE driver is hugely improved, and now delays 5 usec after some commands. <br />We also have a totally new aztcd driver layout, making the driver look <br />even prettier than it did before, at no actual change of code!<br /><br />For those of you who want to play games, or are just security-conscious, <br />the RandomDriver(tm) has also been upgraded, while keeping full <br />compatibility and allowing your APM-aware hardware to shut down cleanly <br />at halt time.<br /><br />Do the wonders never end? The line printer driver checks off-line status <br />before doing anything else, so instead of bogus "out of paper" messages <br />you get the hugely improved "printer offline" message. Yee-Haa!<br /><br />Also, the AIC7xxx driver hs been updated to "patch2" status, and is much <br />more stable for some people. <br /><br />What would you pay for all this? $349.95? $34.95? 14.95? No, it's all <br />COMPLETELY FREE (where permitted by state laws) and can be downloaded <br />from a ftp site near you!<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
