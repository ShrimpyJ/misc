As a<br />&gt; result I resorted to a map of the world instead. This is just a cut and<br />&gt; paste prototype made from available clip art (I am no artist) but I think<br />&gt; that it portrays the right idea.<br />&gt; Give me some feedback on this and I'll see if I can find a technically<br />&gt; good artist to work up a better version.<br />&gt; Sorry that I don't know a better place to put this.<br /><br />Somebody had a logo competition announcement, maybe people can send their <br />ideas to a web-site..<br /><br />Anyway, this one looks like the poor penguin is not really strong enough to<br />hold up the world, and it's going to get squashed. Not a good, positive logo,<br />in that respect..<br /><br />Now, when you think about penguins, first take a deep calming breath, and<br />then think "cuddly". Take another breath, and think "cute". Go back to<br />"cuddly" for a while (and go on breathing), then think "contented". <br /><br />With me so far? Good..<br /><br />Now, with penguins, (cuddly such), "contented" means it has either just<br />gotten laid, or it's stuffed on herring. Take it from me, I'm an expert on<br />penguins, those are really the only two options.<br /><br />Now, working on that angle, we don't really want to be associated with a <br />randy penguin (well, we do, but it's not politic, so we won't), so we <br />should be looking at the "stuffed to its brim with herring" angle here.<br /><br />So when you think "penguin", you should be imagining a slighly overweight<br />penguin (*), sitting down after having gorged itself, and having just burped. <br />It's sitting there with a beatific smile - the world is a good place to be<br />when you have just eaten a few gallons of raw fish and you can feel another<br />"burp" coming. <br /><br />(*) Not FAT, but you should be able to see that it's sitting down because <br />it's really too stuffed to stand up. Think "bean bag" here.<br /><br />Now, if you have problems associating yourself with something that gets <br />off by eating raw fish, think "chocolate" or something, but you get the <br />idea. <br /><br />Ok, so we should be thinking of a lovable, cuddly, stuffed penguin <br />sitting down after having gorged itself on herring. Still with me?<br /><br />NOW comes the hard part. With this image firmly etched on your eyeballs, you<br />then scetch a stylizied version of it. Not a lot of detail - just a black<br />brush-type outline (you know the effect you get with a brush where the<br />thickness of the line varies). THAT requires talent.  Give people the<br />outline, and they should say [ sickly sweet voice, babytalk almost ]"Ooh,<br />what a cuddly penguin, I bet he is just _stuffed_ with herring", and small<br />children will jump up and down and scream "mommy mommy, can I have one too?". <br /><br />Then we can do a larger version with some more detail (maybe leaning <br />against a globe of the world, but I don't think we really want to give <br />any "macho penguin" image here about Atlas or anything). That more <br />detailed version can spank billy-boy to tears for all I care, or play <br />ice-hockey with the FreeBSD demon. But the simple, single penguin would <br />be the logo, and the others would just be that cuddly penguin being used <br />as an actor in some tableau.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
