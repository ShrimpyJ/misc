Certainly developers who send in their PGP public<br />&gt; keys would check the next version that is published and make sure<br />&gt; that they key that went in the CREDITS file is indeed their own.<br /><br />Not only don't I use PGP, I don't want PGP-signed email, and I don't even <br />want MIME-encoded email.<br /><br />Too bad Zimmerman wasn't convicted - he wasn't guilty of breaking any <br />silly cryptography laws, but he _was_ guilty of very bad programming. The <br />PGP single-character escape stuff is broken, in bad taste, and should not <br />be allowed (*). <br /><br />The people who created MIME not only should be convicted, they should be <br />shot on the spot. I have a reasonably mime-aware mailer (pine), but I <br />_still_ have more problems with MIME mail than I ever had with non-MIME. <br />I'm seriously considering refusing to even look at mails or patches that <br />use MIME-encoding other than cleartext.<br /><br />And don't tell me "MIME works fine" - I get quite enough emails, thank <br />you very much. It doesn't work fine at all.<br /><br />(*) PGP _should_ use a escape sequence, but using a single-character one (and<br />a pretty normal one at that!) is arrogant and terminally stupid. It should<br />use something like "---------- PGP-" as the escape-sequence at the start of a<br />line (and _if_ it needs to escape it, it adds a full extra line of escape<br />data in the above format), which would mean it wouldn't mess with any normal<br />means of communication. <br /><br />As it stands now, I have to edit the damn thing by hand or install a program<br />that I don't want, and this results in me mostly ignoring the damn broken<br />thing. Yes, I'm grumpy, and that's because I just I got _two_ mime-encoded<br />mails that didn't even uudecode cleanly before I edited them by hand. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
