However, other <br />&gt; than hearing that Linus really likes penguins, I have no idea what a <br />&gt; penguin has to do with Linux.  Could someone fill this gap in my <br />&gt; knowledge (without too much flaming for ignorance) as to what the <br />&gt; significance of the penguin is?<br /><br />Umm.. You don't have any gap to fill in.<br /><br />"Linus likes penguins". That's it. There was even a headline on it in <br />some Linux Journal some time ago (I was bitten by a Killer Penguin in <br />Australia - I'm not kidding). Penguins are fun.<br /><br />As to why use a penguin as a logo? No good reason, really. But a logo <br />doesn't really ave to _mean_ anything - it's the association that counts. <br />And I can think of many worse things than have linux being associated <br />with penguins.<br /><br />Having a penguin as a logo also gives more freedom to people wanting to <br />use linux-related material: instead of being firmly fixed with a specific <br />logo (the triangle, or just "Linux 2.0" or some other abstract thing), <br />using something like a penguin gives people the chance to make <br />modifications that are still recognizable. <br /><br />So you can have a real live penguin on a CD cover, for example, and <br />people will get the association. Or you can have a penguin that does <br />something specific (a Penguin writing on wordperfect for the WP Linux CD, <br />whatever - you get the idea).<br /><br />Compare that to a more abstract logo (like the windows logo - it's not a <br />bad logo in itself). You can't really do anything with a logo like that. <br />It just "is".<br /><br />Anyway, go to "<a href="http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/&quot;">http://www.isc.tamu.edu/~lewing/linux/"</a> for some nice <br />examples..<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
