These cases _tend_ to be due to APM: I'd <br />suggest people seeing this try to disable all APM features (both from the <br />BIOS setups and from Linux itself). I suspect that there are APM BIOS'es <br />out there that scribble over memory that Linux is using (they probably <br />"know" that the machine is running DOS/Windows and it uses the "standard" <br />DOS/Windows memory layout).<br /><br />Note that you really need to check the BIOS too - even with the kernel<br />compiled without APM support you may have BIOS accesses through the so-called<br />"system management mode" on Pentium chips, which Linux doesn't even know<br />about. <br /><br />Oh, btw, I haven't gone through all reports very carefully: I've been <br />reading mail for several hours, and I'm still only a third way through my <br />mailfolder that has accumulated during my trip to Argentina. As you may <br />guess, this means that most mails I have are not read very carefully. <br />Don't expect me to be up to full speed until next week..<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
