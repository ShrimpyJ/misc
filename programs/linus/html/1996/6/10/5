If <br />you really want an unsigned char, please type it out.<br /><br />In the kernel, if you want a "byte" (and you really mean a 8-bit entity), <br />use "u8" (or __u8 in header files due to namespace pollution). It's <br />shorter, but more importantly it also makes it very clear that you really <br />want a 8-bit entity, bot a "char". There is a rather important <br />distinction. <br /><br />For "char", you are reasonably safe in assuming it's 8 bits on most <br />machines, but it gets _really_ interesting when you want 32 bits: do <br />_not_ use "long" which is definitely wrong, and don't use "int" while is <br />just sometimes wrong. Use "u32".<br /><br />Some of the kernel device drivers use "uint" or "unsigned long" in<br />hardware-specific structures (the layout of a hardware structure in memory,<br />for example), and this is just a mail to developers to ask them to consider<br />using the u8/u16/u32 types instead (there are also s8/s16/s32 types, but you<br />should be _very_ wary about using them: there is very seldom a need for a<br />_signed_ quantity that has a certain number of bits). <br /><br />People who use BYTE/WORD/LONG (and their "U" versions) have been too <br />tainted by DOS, and I can only pray that you can see the error of your <br />ways and slowly recover.<br /><br />Oh, and if there isn't any hardware (or protocol, or disk layout) reason <br />to use any of u8/u16/u32, please don't. For internal kernel things where <br />the exact number of bits doesn't really matter, use "int" or "long" and <br />add the full "unsigned" if you want to make it clear that it's an <br />unsigned entity.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
