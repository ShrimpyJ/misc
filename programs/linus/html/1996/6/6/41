The fact remains, if linux is to be <br />&gt; &gt; supported by game developers it needs to have the basic video support <br />&gt; &gt; required.<br />&gt; <br />&gt;   Ok, here's the fundamental point I was trying to make:  Do we want, as <br />&gt; a design goal, for Linux to be an OS for game developers?  Is "supported <br />&gt; by game developers" really a goal for Linux/UNIX?<br /><br />Actually, I'd say YES here..<br /><br />I consider games pretty important - we don't want to get snotty and tell people<br />about "real work" - we want to have the best all-round OS available, and that<br />definitely does mean games too..<br /><br />In short, I'd _love_ to have lots of good games, and I was _really_ happy when<br />DOOM was made available for linux.<br /><br />&gt;   It seems to me that this is not the direction Linux should take, or IS <br />&gt; taking.  Is Linux supposed to be an alternative to Windows 95 and the <br />&gt; Mac or is it supposed to be an alternative to Windows NT, SCO Unix, <br />&gt; Solaris, etc...?<br /><br />Oh, I'd like to be an alternative to Win95 any day. <br /><br />The SCO Unix and Solaris kind of OS we can already pretty well replace: the<br />issues there are not really technical. WinNT is a joke.<br /><br />We _do_ want exactly the kinds of applications Win95 has, and that certainly<br />includes games, even though I consider the "real" applications like Applixware<br />even more important.<br /><br />&gt;   Now, if we can make Linux a great game platform WITHOUT compromising <br />&gt; these goals, then fine.  However, at least Linus and some others don't <br />&gt; seem to think that's possible.<br /><br />Here you're touching on one of the problems. It's pretty hard to support games<br />in a _good_ manner without just giving up the whole machine. And I have to<br />admit that I tend to use the fast machines where a game under X is perfectly<br />reasonable. I'm not talking "solitaire" here, I'm talking raw action, 3D stuff,<br />"a better DOOM than DOOM" too.<br /><br />However, we do have one thing going for us: technology. Machines aren't getting<br />slower, and I doubt that the _real_ problem with games under Linux is the fact<br />that you should use X to write them. The _real_ problem is that most of the<br />developers are under DOS - THAT is why there are more and better games for DOS,<br />not because Linux lacks anything in this area.<br /><br />In short, I'm definitely NOT arguing against games. But we need to be very<br />careful about what we do about graphics, and that's why I've been calling for X<br />rather than any other solution. Because X is a viable option even in the long<br />run, while I don't see any other "standards" emerge (note that "standards" are<br />not just pieces of paper: the BEST standards are the de-facto standards that<br />never were paper in the first place, but somebody just went out and did it, and<br />it was so good that it _became_ a standard).<br /><br />The GGI stuff might well become a standard that is worth supporting. It just<br />isn't that yet..<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
