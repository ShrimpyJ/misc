It<br />&gt; isn't about some bug in the code ;) However, I think the new named pipe<br />&gt; code in the kernel breaks a lot of applications.<br />&gt; As I see it, there _is_ a difference between pipes and fifos: you<br />&gt; cannot ever re-open a pipe, but you can re-open a fifo. With the<br />&gt; new code, a server (init) can only accept one request on a named pipe.<br />&gt; After the client (telinit) has closed the fifo, read() keeps returning<br />&gt; 0 instead of blocking and select() tells init there is data waiting...<br />&gt; <br />&gt; With the old SunOS behaviour it was possible to open a fifo once,<br />&gt; do a select() on it and accept incoming requests from different<br />&gt; clients. Now the server has to keep open()ing and close()ing the fifo,<br />&gt; which is not pretty and will break lots of stuff.<br />&gt; <br />&gt; Linus, could you please either explain a way around this or<br />&gt; restore the old behaviour of select() on pipes?<br /><br />Restoring the old behaviour is simple: there is a BROKEN_SUNOS_FIFO <br />define (or something close to that) in fs/pipe.c, and defininf that will <br />use the old code.<br /><br />However, I do like the new code better ("new" - it's actually the <br />original linux behaviour, but I had to change it because too many SunOS <br />people complained). And the new behaviour is also the same as Solaris etc <br />SVR4 boxes, so any truly _portable_ program shouldn't break anyway.<br /><br />Of course, sysvinit isn't necessarily meant to be portable, and as such <br />it's perfectly ok to depend on linux behavioural features. <br /><br />I don't like the SunOS (pre-81) behaviour, because some programs _want_ <br />to be able to know when the clients have gone away, and returning 1 for <br />select when there are no writers is the "logically" correct thing to do <br />anyway, when you look at what "read()" does. <br /><br />However, I don't feel strongly enough about this to not even consider <br />changing it back: I could do that. I'm not 100% sure I want to, though, <br />so I'd like some feedback from some more people. What do people think? <br />Especailly people who actually _use_ named pipes..<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
