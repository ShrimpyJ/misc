It was done<br />as a pre-loaded shared library, and because of that it was a lot more<br />flexible than any kernel implementation would ever be (it was not<br />limited to the unix mount global state: it was used more like Plan-9's<br />dynamic per-process mounting). <br /><br />After having seen that, I don't think I necessarily would even want a<br />kernel implementation.  It simply was so much better done in user<br />space.. <br /><br />The stuff had been done by Dave Korn (or Korn shell fame (and don't<br />flame me if his first name isn't "Dave", my mind is going)) at AT&amp;T. <br />Damn, but I can't remember his email address.. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
