(This is with a 1.3.79 kernel).<br /><br />Probably. It depends on what your setup is, and especially on _how_ the <br />programs do their writes.<br /><br />Check out that you have rsize=8192 and wsize=8192, and then the <br />write-side caching shouldn't matter for most programs that use buffered <br />stdio.<br /><br />However, programs that do not use buffered stdio (do raw "write()" system <br />calls with small buffers), or that use a line-buffered approach will be <br />hurt by the lack of write-side caching (well, not so much caching as <br />"coalescing" of write requests, although the way I'd do it would be to <br />use the page cache to do the coalescing which is why I call it caching).<br /><br />In short, for many programs there is not much of a difference. Sadly, <br />some programs are especially stupid, and one exacmple of this is "as", if <br />I remember correctly. At least some versions of the GNU assembler did a <br />"write()" system call for every instruction, so you ended up with _huge_ <br />amounts of NFS packets. Now, that's arguably a misfeature in the program, <br />but on the other hand we _could_ be faster.<br /><br />Anyway, the first thing you should check out is that you use a rsize and <br />wsize of 8192, not the default 1024. Just add "rsize=8192,wsize=8192" to <br />your NFS mount options in your /etc/fstab if you don't have them already.<br /><br />And remember, there _is_ life after 2.0. We'll get this issue worked out <br />soon enough, so don't be too worried about it.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
