But it isn't just the different pci-ethernet<br />&gt; variants (eg 21140,21143, pnic, etc...), but also the physical<br />&gt; interfaces: mii, sym, serial, etc.... Then throw in EEPROM formats,<br />&gt; different assignments of hardware control bits, etc...<br />&gt; <br />&gt; That's a big space to cover in one driver. All of this makes tulip<br />&gt; relatively large and complex as drivers go. IIRC, the source is<br />&gt; 100k+.  And it has *worked* for me quite well. However I'm on the more<br />&gt; modern hardware that gets the most attention. Testing for side effects<br />&gt; against older hardware under these circumstances is at once tedious<br />&gt; and difficult.<br /><br />Note that we've had that happen before for other drivers, and the sane way<br />to handle it tends to be to split the driver up.<br /><br />For example, see the IDE driver. It has core IDE functionality, but then<br />multiple "sub-drivers" to do tuning etc. That may not be required for the<br />tulip driver, but if the driver is starting to look fragile, then by all<br />means at least give it some serious thought as an option. Often source<br />duplication is a much lesser evil, and the evil of trying to handle<br />everything with one approach can be a complete disaster.<br /><br />Remember: the UNIX philosophy is to NOT try to create the "GNU Emacs of<br />drivers". Do one thing, and do it well, even if it means that you need to<br />have another driver for a card that isn't really all that similar any<br />more.<br /><br />See how the ncr53c7,8xx SCSI driver is handled: there are actually two<br />drivers, where the newer driver only handles the newer cards, and as a<br />result BOTH drivers are simpler (and the newer driver can be noticeably<br />faster because it doesn't have to worry about issues that only happen with<br />the old and arguably broken cards).<br /><br />Splitting a driver tends to mean that the support for old cards stagnates.<br />But that's fine - old cards do not change over time, and it makes it<br />easier to change both the new and the old driver without having to worry<br />about breaking the "other" one, because they are now independent.<br /><br />For example, to just point out that this is not a problem just for network<br />drivers: the same thing is definitely apparently happening with the PCMCIA<br />host controllers. They are all just "similar enough" that one driver tries<br />to handle them all, but as a result that one driver is quite fragile, and<br />when somebody tries to fix an old ISA card that can break cardbus support<br />and vice versa.<br /><br />It's happened to many drivers over time, and if somebody really is willing<br />to try to clean it up, I just want to say that at least as far as _I_ am<br />concerned, I don't think it is a bad idea to have several drivers for<br />similar hardware. You can try to share as much code as you reasonably can<br />(see for example the 8390 driver that does this fairly successfully),<br />without thinking that there has to be ONE driver that handles ALL 8390<br />cards.<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
