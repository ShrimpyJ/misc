I know this may incur the wrath of Linus (David<br />&gt; Hinds comes to mind here...), but continuing to ship tulip v0.89H with<br />&gt; the kernel (as of 2.3.21 at least), which doesn't work with shipping<br />&gt; Intel 21143 chips sets, when things like v0.91g and v0.91m are<br />&gt; available seems a little odd.<br /><br />Nobody has sent me any updates.<br /><br />I basically never EVER search for patches on the net. If they don't come<br />to me in email, I take that to mean that the author isn't interested in<br />getting them into the standard kernel. The end.<br /><br />And if the author cannot be bothered to send me timely updates, the author<br />also looks damn silly if he then complains that I don't use his code.<br /><br />Note the "timely". It's not enough to send me the patch once in a blue<br />moon (Donald doesn't do even that - even though I've asked him face to<br />face, and he always says he will). Again, if the author cannot be bothered<br />to MAINTAIN his patches, it's not worth my time even trying to do it for<br />him: not because I'm a lazy bastard (which I am), but simply because<br />especially with drivers I need help with maintenance, and an old<br />unmaintained driver with known problems is better than a new unmaintained<br />driver with unknown problems.<br /><br />For example, I do not generally apply large patches. Ask Alan Cox, for<br />example, who does a hell of a good job of maintaining a large portion of<br />the kernel (hats off to Alan), and then ALSO does a hell of a good job in<br />splitting the patches up in their original components.<br /><br />When I get something like the current "ac" patches from Alan, I don't get<br />just one email with the patch - I _literally_ get about 50 patches that<br />are independent - one per driver, one per subsystem, one per new feature<br />like PCI detection. And then I apply about 48 of them, and explain to him<br />about the two I didn't like and why I didn't apply them.<br /><br />Most people don't see that kind of code maintenance - they see the full<br />"ac" patch-set, and then some time later they see the patches in my<br />kernel. And sometimes people wonder why the end result isn't the same as<br />the "ac" tree - now you know why. It's either because I decided to not<br />apply a part of it, or (quite often) it's because Alan didn't even send<br />part of it to me, because he knew it had some other issues.<br /><br />&gt; I hear claims of tulip driver bugs, but rarely any specifics. Part of<br />&gt; that is the nature of drivers, but I'm on both the l-k and l-t lists,<br />&gt; and I specifically filter on tulip, and I don't see lots of bug<br />&gt; reports.<br /><br />Would you act as an interface between Donald and the standard kernel (ie<br />me and Alan)? Note that it goes both ways - right now Donald doesn't pick<br />up on fixes made by others in the standard kernel, and the same old bug<br />that has been fixed in the standard kernel often shows up in "new" drivers<br />later.<br /><br />&gt; QED.  Now think of the workload on Donald trying to cope with this. I<br />&gt; would find it just a little discouraging. If the kernel at least<br />&gt; shipped with the latest driver from the maintainer, then the rest of<br />&gt; us little people would have a common platform to work from. <br /><br />Indeed. It would be helpful for Donald as well if he didn't try to<br />maintain tens of patches outside the official kernel tree.<br /><br />&gt; If tulip (and other drivers) aren't being maintained, then say so. But<br />&gt; AFAIK that isn't the case. Donald's the maintainer.  He should be<br />&gt; backed up.<br /><br />Donald is not the maintainer as far as I am concerned, because I never see<br />any maintenance. He's the AUTHOR, but that is not necessarily the same<br />thing (being the author does mean that he automatically gets the right to<br />be the maintainer if he wants to).<br /><br />			Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
