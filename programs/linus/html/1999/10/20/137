The only thing you should maybe check<br />&gt; even in a 1MB diff from Donald for example is whatever it's leaving:<br /><br />But that is what I do.<br /><br />Talk to people. When a maintainer sends me patches to an area that he<br />maintains, I just apply it. I read it through, but I _very_ seldom do<br />anything but just feed it directly to "patch".<br /><br />The only requirement I have is that the patches aren't too large, and even<br />that is slightly relaxed for architecture updates. And that's not so much<br />because I want to read through it (even if I do), but because I know there<br />will be bugs, and when the sh*t hits the fan I want me and others to be<br />able to ask things like "ok, did it work with 2.3.15? and you're sure it's<br />broken in 2.3.16?" and then be able to get some kind of rational end<br />result of that question.<br /><br />&gt; But Alan's patches are usually involved in the "kernel" of the "kernel".<br />&gt; Or maybe more precisely: the generic parts of it. Drivers are a much<br />&gt; much different matter. <br /><br />And that is why Alan actually gets a few rejects every once in a while. <br /><br />&gt; Don't wonder a firm self assured and competent person doesn't feel <br />&gt; oblidget for the slavish work of the splitting (which is indeed <br />&gt; plenty of), where it's really not neccesary at all for any technical<br />&gt; reason other then maybe someones need for total controll.<br /><br />Note that you don't have to split the patches up. The way it _should_ be<br />done is that the patches are sent off often enough that they just get<br />applied.<br /><br />The "split things up" is something you need to do only when that is too<br />late, ie things like the current backlog of network driver patches. It<br />shouldn't need to happen, and in fact most people do not do that (Alan<br />does it, but Alan does it mainly because he is one of the few maintainers<br />that are all OVER the place, and he has his own full tree - he's basically<br />"Linus with a beard").<br /><br />&gt; I remember the discussion about the tulip where you where arguing<br />&gt; over and over again in fact against the competence of Donald.<br /><br />I was NOT arguing against the competence of Donald.<br /><br />But with both Tulip and eepro100, people have asked me to use drivers that<br />simply do not work on my machines. What do you expect me to do?<br /><br />Should I say<br /><br /> "Oh, I'm sure that this driver is really much better than the old one,<br />  despite the fact that the old one works for me and the new one does<br />  not"?<br /><br />or should I say<br /><br /> "I don't care if you say that it works for somebody else - if it stopped<br />  working for me, then it's probably going to stop working for a lot of<br />  other people too"<br /><br />I'll take #2 any day, and I don't think you'll be able to convince me<br />otherwise.<br /><br />The other reason patches get ignored even from maintainers is if they<br />obviously haven't been tracking the mainline at all. For example, I (and<br />others) do occasional cleanups, where we've removed #ifdef's that test for<br />linux-2.0, because too much baggage is just too much baggage. You're<br />better off having two versions, than having one version that tries to do<br />everything (see my pervious post on this issue from another angle; it's<br />true of software as well as hardware).<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
