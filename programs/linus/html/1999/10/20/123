Let it in<br />&gt; and forward everything to Donald. (procmail could even do it...)<br />&gt; That's what maintainers are for.<br /><br />I have occasionally forwarded stuff to Donald. More often, I forward<br />things to Alan and Davem, simply because they tend to know networking<br />issues well, and I tend to get more response out of them ;)<br /><br />And no, I _don't_ feel responsible for specific device drivers, and sure,<br />I could take the approach that "what do I care if a driver is broken?".<br />And in fact, without a maintainer, that is what I often end up doing,<br />although it it turns out to be a problem (it isn't always) I try to prod<br />people who are silly enough to send me patches to maybe become a<br />maintainer..<br /><br />But what would happen if all the drivers were somewhere out in web-land,<br />and to find the drivers for your random combination of hardware you'd have<br />to search five different web-sites from five different maintainers? Do you<br />really think a system can survive that way and find more users? And ever<br />be tested as a "sum of all parts"? I don't.<br /><br />So in real life, you need to have a "standard base" that includes all the<br />stuff most people are reasonably expected to use. It doesn't include some<br />of the more esoteric stuff (hard realtime, specific drivers for hardware<br />that exists only in rather special places etc), but it certainly has to<br />have drivers for things like a random tulip card, would you not say?<br /><br />And maintaining that "standard base" is what I do. Others do it too,<br />notably SuSE and Redhat. Much of that "standard base" is based on their<br />work, in addition to the obvious work by the actual people who create the<br />actual drivers and new features.<br /><br />But exactly because Linux is _NOT_ a "one entity does everything"<br />proposition, it is NOT the case that I go out on the net and find<br />everything I want to have in the full package. I very much depend on<br />people like David Miller, Alan Cox, Ingo Molnar, and a hundred other<br />people who not only maintain their own subsystems, but also help me in<br />maintaining those subsystems as part of the larger whole.<br /><br />The problem in question is when a maintainer maintains the subsystem, but<br />does not try to help in maintaining the whole. See?
