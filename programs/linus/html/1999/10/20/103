There should be<br />many small incremental releases, because whatever Donald or others say,<br />especially with drivers you are often in the situation that you cannot<br />from looking at the source see whether something is broken or not.<br /><br />So it needs to be released often, and TESTED often. Which implies that the<br />test-drivers should be part of the standard development kernel, because if<br />they aren't, they aren't going to get very wide testing.<br /><br />For example, what has happened multiple times is that the 1% for whom some<br />particular old network driver does not work will try out Donalds new<br />drivers, and what do you know? It works for them! And people think that<br />that means that the new driver has to be much better than the old one,<br />right?<br /><br />Wrong. The new driver is NOT necessarily better at all. Not only has it<br />been tested by much fewer people, it has been tested by a SELF-SELECTED<br />group of people. Which may mean that the new driver fails horribly for a<br />lot of people where the old driver was fine - because the new driver<br />effectively has ZERO testing for common hardware that worked fine with the<br />old driver.<br /><br />This is not worth discussing further. Timely incremental changes are just<br />so OBVIOUSLY better to anybody who has done any real maintenance that the<br />argument is pointless. It's true in non-Linux settings too - why do you<br />think commercial software companies have regression tests and a large<br />testbed of different machines that are always active?<br /><br />If Donald doesn't do the nice incremental patches, then somebody else will<br />end up doing them. But that also means that Donald loses the right to then<br />complain about others doing the work that he somehow considers "his".<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
