So start_xmit, rx and tx would be completely shared. Those<br />aren't the ones that have been particularly fragile.<br /><br />But the timeout handling and the media handling could probably be<br />considered a separate driver altogether. Basically, the functions tend to<br />be big case statements anyway, and maybe that should be be made more<br />modular, so that it would be clearer what code is for the DC21041 and what<br />is for the DC21142, because they have different routines to handle them.<br /><br />Note that I don't personally think the tulip driver is all that confusing,<br />there are certainly much worse drivers out there. It just came up as an<br />example by Richard as being prone to break in subtle ways, and splitting<br />up the parts that break and making them more independent of each other is<br />probably a good maintenance strategy.<br /><br />&gt; Keep in mind that the issue isn't just about tulip.c, or even the dozen<br />&gt; other PCI network drivers I updated to remove the backwards compatibility at<br />&gt; the request of Linus.  It's about the process.  I've been developing drivers<br />&gt; this way, with supporting web pages, mailing lists and levels of test<br />&gt; releases, for many years.  I see people claiming that the process isn't<br />&gt; transparent when they aren't on the mailing lists and obviously haven't<br />&gt; looked at how much work and discussion have passed.<br /><br />Note that nobody is suggesting that you dismantle the mailing lists.<br />Instead, people are suggesting that you should _also_ make the thing more<br />available, together with more history of what has been going on, and be<br />aware that a driver on its own is useless - you as a driver writer would<br />probably prefer it if the rest of the system stayed at 1.2.13 forever so<br />that you wouldn't have to be part of a whole.<br /><br />But the fact is that no driver is an island. Even if you'd like them to<br />be.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
