The upper<br />&gt; 128 bytes of the IO window just map the same registers as the lower 128<br />&gt; bytes. Without any concept of resource allocation, it did not seem this<br />&gt; usefull to care about more than 128 bytes of IO registers. Now, we<br />&gt; probably should want to care about the full 256 bytes IO window for this<br />&gt; chip. <br /><br />No, that's fine. That's exactly the kind of explanation I would have<br />expected, and I think it's actually _nice_ that /proc kind of shows both<br />parts of the picture - no point in making the driver claim the whole<br />window if it's only using half of it.<br /><br />It's not as if the resource allocation protects against _bad_ users<br />anyway: if somebody wants to mess with the IO registers he could just do<br />so directly without bothering to try to allocate it as a busy resource. So<br />there's no worry that some "bad" driver would try to access the card using<br />the upper half - if somebody does something that silly on purpose, then<br />it's not your problem, and you can't force him to behave by just marking<br />the whole region used.<br /><br />The PCI resource has been corectly identified, and as such there won't be<br />anybody trying to allocate the area in question for any other bus.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
