It's the semaphore code.<br /><br />All the code you're looking at is almost completely uninteresting for<br />performance handling: by the time the code is invoced you've already had<br />contention on the semaphore, and you just need to make sure that you get<br />the right result. <br /><br />And even if that code ever becomes a bottle-neck, the right approach is<br />NOT to make it all that much faster: the right approach is to make sure<br />that the semaphore that gets tons of contention is fixed up. <br /><br />So I want the semaphores to be stable and simple, because the fast path<br />has already been done somewhere else.<br /><br />I agree with your wake-one semantic issue, but I disagree with just about<br />all of the other changes.<br /><br />&gt; Does somebody knows a place that uses the semaphores initialized with a<br />&gt; count &gt; 1 ? I don't.<br /><br />So?<br /><br />&gt; Supposing the seamphores are mutex you have two choices in down_trylock():<br /><br />You have one choice: fix things up. It already failed, there's no point in<br />doing anything else. <br /><br />We tried to be clever before. There was absolutely no data that it was<br />ever a win, and there were lots of indications that it was buggy. Let's<br />not make that mistake again. Don't optimize code that doesn't need<br />optimization.<br /><br />Btw, the case you optimize for is the case that is supposed to be<br />_extremely_ rare even in the presense of contention. You optimize not just<br />for the contention-case, you optimize for the specific case where the<br />values are racing and changing on different CPU's at the same time. Do you<br />_really_ think that it is worth it, considering that you make the<br />semaphore behaviour more complex?<br /><br />I really don't.<br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
