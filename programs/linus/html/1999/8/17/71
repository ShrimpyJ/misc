It's doing something wrong in the<br />&gt; first place, <br /><br />To expand on the above:<br /><br /> If you write a driver and you want to give direct DMA access to some<br />program, the way to do it is NOT by using some magic ioctl number and<br />doing stupid things like some drivers do (ie notably bttv).<br /><br />The way to do it is to just be up-front about the fact that the user<br />process wants direct access to the buffers that the IO is done from, and<br />use an explicit mmap() on the file descriptor. The driver can then<br />allocate a contiguous chunk of memory of the right type, and with the<br />right restrictions, and then let the nopage() function page it into the<br />user process space. <br /><br />Suddenly, such a _wellwritten_ driver no longer needs to play games with<br />the page tables. And such a well written driver wouldn't have any problems<br />at all with the BIGMEM patches.<br /><br />Btw, this is not somehting new. Quite a number of sound drivers do exactly<br />this, and have been doing it for several years. I don't know why the bttv<br />driver has to be so broken, but as far as I can tell it's one of two (the<br />other one being some completely obscure planb driver for power macs).<br /><br />Oh, and I notice that the USB cpia driver does bad things too, although it<br />seems to be limited to vmalloc'ed memory so it's not nearly as horrible. <br />It seems to have copied the bug from the bttv sources. Johannes, could you<br />look at that a bit, it really _is_ going to break horribly at some point,<br />and I hadn't noticed until after I did a quick grep.. You can use<br />__get_free_pages() to grab a larger area than just a single page. <br /><br />		Linus<br /><br /><br />-<br />To unsubscribe from this list: send the line "unsubscribe linux-kernel" in<br />the body of a message to majordomo&#64;vger.rutgers.edu<br />Please read the FAQ at <a href="http://www.tux.org/lkml/">http://www.tux.org/lkml/</a><br /><br /></pre><div align="center"><div class="shariff" data-services="[&quot;reddit&quot;]" data-theme="grey" data-lang="en" data-backend-url="//shariff.lkml.org/index.php"></div></div></td><td width="32" rowspan="2" class="c" valign="top"><img src="/images/icornerr.gif" width="32" height="32" alt="\" /></td></tr><tr><td align="right" valign="bottom">
